Glimpsed from afar, it seemed a reminder that even in 2020, politics still boils down to this: small-town voters braving the elements to listen to an underdog candidate speak truth to power.Except Andy Meehan, the star of that Saturday afternoon's generously termed \"rally,\" was not necessarily looking to stick it to The Man. He was there to \"FIGHT FAKE FITZ!\" -- a.k.a. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican seeking re-election in Pennsylvania's First Congressional District. A conservative challenging Mr. Fitzpatrick for their party's nomination, Mr. Meehan is promising voters that he, unlike his \"disloyal\" opponent, will always be faithful to The Man.\"President Trump is going to win in 2020,\" Mr. Meehan, a 55-year-old financial adviser, told his audience. \"Do you want a half-baked, fake Republican on the ticket who's going to get in on his coattails again? And then not support him?\"He shook the snow off his cowboy boots and went on. \"I'm a man of principles,\" he said. \"I support the president's America First agenda, and I'm going to go to Washington, and I will vote for it.\"Such is the nature of the Republican primary season in the Donald Trump era: self-proclaimed outsiders marketing themselves as loyalists to a man who is now the ultimate insider. Challenges to incumbents from the right are nothing new. But whereas conservative primary candidates once fashioned their campaigns as referendums on reckless federal spending or the elitist sensibilities of leadership, their pitches are much simpler now, carte blanche offerings of complete and total fealty to the president.And with Mr. Trump's stranglehold on his party, their targets are much fewer, too. Mr. Meehan's candidacy is significant not so much on its own merits but in that there are hardly any others currently like it: In this new moment of G.O.P. unity, it is difficult to find a district where one can claim -- at least credibly -- that the incumbent Republican has been insufficiently supportive of the president.But complete and total fealty is no longer a sure ticket to Mr. Trump's support. Hovering over all of these races is the Senate impeachment trial, and how Republican incumbents respond stands to be a critical consideration in how they are viewed by voters -- and by Mr. Trump. The president, who once seemed to believe that no slight was too small, no grievance too stale, now appears to regard lawmakers who covet his endorsement through the prism of impeachment alone. And with every House Republican having defended the president, G.O.P. primary challengers are now struggling to successfully argue that their opponents are disloyal.Pennsylvania's First is a rare district where support for Mr. Trump is not a given. Mr. Fitzpatrick has voted with Mr. Trump less than any other House Republican, and just 36.5 percent of the time in the current congressional session. In July 2019, he was one of four Republicans to formally condemn the president's comments about four progressive congresswomen as racist. Which is to say that the Make America Great Again faithful, in their quest to excise yet more of the president's dissenters from Congress in 2020, smelled blood.A handful of Trumpworld alumni have come together to lead Mr. Meehan's efforts, including Matt Braynard, the former director of data and strategy for the Trump campaign. Mr. Meehan's team is wishcasting the race as \"Cantor-Brat 2.0,\" a reference to the stunning Republican primary in 2014, when Dave Brat, an economics professor, defeated the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, in Virginia.The races are perhaps similar only in that Mr. Meehan's bid is a long shot. Mr. Fitzpatrick, 46, has the good will of voters who supported his late brother, Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican who represented the district when it was known as the Eighth. In 2018, it was redrawn to give Democrats a slight edge, meaning Brian Fitzpatrick is likely to retain the support of local party leadership hoping to pick off independents in the general election. Indeed, the Bucks County Republican Committee chairwoman, Patricia Poprik, said her members \"stand behind Brian Fitzpatrick's commitment to individual liberty and freedom, and commend his common sense approach to dealing with issues in Congress,\" adding that Mr. Meehan \"does not represent the values of our party.\"Still, Mr. Fitzpatrick has gone so far as to issue an attack ad against Mr. Meehan, calling him \"Pelosi's Pawn in PA-01.\"\"Fitzpatrick has to take it seriously, because outside MAGA interference can mobilize and fund-raise and have a significant effect in primaries, without any long-term strategy for the actual district,\" said Rory Cooper, Mr. Cantor's former communications director.Primaries like Mr. Fitzpatrick's are scarce in large part because G.O.P. lawmakers know precisely how to avoid them. In the last few years, Republicans who've dipped a toe in anti-Trump waters have quickly recoiled, as though a cottonmouth lurked just below the surface. Take Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina: On Feb. 25, 2019, he wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post that while he supported the president's \"vision on border security,\" he would \"vote against\" the declaration of a national emergency.Local Republican leaders excoriated Mr. Tillis for putting himself \"in opposition to the president.\" They approached Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina's Sixth District about a primary challenge, and the Club for Growth, a conservative political action group, commissioned a poll on Mr. Walker and other state Republicans' chances against the senator.Not three weeks after his op-ed published, Mr. Tillis reversed course and voted for the national emergency. In June, Mr. Walker announced he would not pursue a primary.\"Tillis was a wake-up call for everyone,\" said Tyler Sandberg, a Republican strategist. \"If you disagreed with something the president did, it was like, 'Be careful; you saw what happened to Tillis.\"'The result is that the National Republican Congressional Committee is no longer consumed by the once inevitable task of neutralizing serious challenges to its members from the right. According to a G.O.P. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions, apart from Mr. Fitzpatrick's race, only a few primaries this cycle have been deemed cause for concern.\"The president's monopoly on Republican voters is more powerful than any ideological or stylistic divide,\" said Nathan Gonzales, editor of Inside Elections and an elections analyst for CQ Roll Call. \"There might be interest in challenging an incumbent from the right or as an outsider, but as long as that member stays close to Trump, there just isn't enough oxygen to get the job done.\"But then there's Representative Kay Granger, the 12-term incumbent of Texas's 12th District. As ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, she's one of the lower chamber's most powerful Republicans. Yet she finds herself confronting her most -- and arguably only -- competitive primary in her two-plus decades in Congress, a challenge driven by charges of a lackluster allegiance to Mr. Trump.On Sept. 24, a technology company executive named Chris Putnam, who promoted himself as an \"outsider\" \"just like President Trump,\" declared his candidacy. As The Texas Tribune reported, in the six days before the close of the quarter on Sept. 30, Mr. Putnam boasted a haul of $456,000, trouncing Ms. Granger's quarter-long effort of $284,000.Ms. Granger is certainly no Brian Fitzpatrick -- unlike her House colleague, she votes with Mr. Trump roughly 97 percent of the time. But flashes of dissent, including her call for Mr. Trump to \"remove himself from consideration as commander in chief\" after the release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in 2016, have been enough to buoy her opponent. In an interview, Mr. Putnam accused Ms. Granger of being a \"full-on Never Trumper\" during the last three years. \"We have to get people who are running for the right reasons,\" he said.That Saturday in Doylestown, Andy Meehan was eager to continue sharing his own reasons. After his rally, he and a few voters fled the snowfall and ducked into a coffee shop. Warming his hands on a mug of hot chocolate, he reminisced about the moment in May 2019 that he decided to challenge Mr. Fitzpatrick, when he saw that the Pennsylvania congressman was one of eight House Republicans to vote for the Equality Act.The sweeping legislation, which bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, prompted blowback from conservatives and others who argued that the bill would undermine female athletes by making sports effectively co-ed. \"And I was on social media,\" Mr. Meehan recalled, \"saying, 'What is this guy doing?\"'In Mr. Meehan's view, Mr. Fitzpatrick was yet another politician falling prey to political correctness, the opposite of the president. Since introducing his campaign by cellphone video on July 4, Mr. Meehan has tried to channel Mr. Trump, railing against identity politics and promising to protect \"election integrity\" from undocumented immigrants.That message appears to have resonated with at least some conservatives. \"We need a fighter because Trump is a fighter,\" said Millie Hillgrube, a 51-year-old sales coordinator, prompting a low chorus of mmhmms around the table.Mr. Meehan and his team are hopeful that his support will catch the president's attention. With little money, and with national Republican leaders already stumping for Mr. Fitzpatrick, a nod from Mr. Trump probably represents Mr. Meehan's best chance. \"I think the White House could potentially choose to become involved,\" said Mr. Braynard, the former Trump campaign data director who is running Mr. Meehan's campaign. \"Because Andy would be a real ally in the president's second term.\"But while the terms dictating Republican primaries may be simpler than ever, so is the president's logic on whether to meddle in them.It's true that Mr. Fitzpatrick voted to condemn the president's words as racist. And it's true that Ms. Granger once called for Mr. Trump to drop out of the 2016 race. But as his eager embrace of Representative Jeff Van Drew, who recently left the Democratic Party to become a Republican, suggests, the president seems willing to forgive such sins in exchange for support in one crucial moment. Mr. Van Drew, of course, voted against impeachment. Mr. Fitzpatrick and Ms. Granger did, too.In other words, those single votes could render campaigns like Mr. Meehan's -- centered on the apostasy of their opponents -- moot. Which means the 2020 primary season, rather than usher in a small new class of Trump die-hards, could instead leave behind a slate of former candidates whose downfall was demanding more loyalty to the president than the president demanded for himself.Indeed, when asked if the president planned to involve himself in Mr. Fitzpatrick's primary, a senior White House official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said Mr. Trump had never discussed it.The official then waved off any concerns about Mr. Fitzpatrick's allegiance to the president. Sure, he may have gone against him on a number of issues, the official said. But he had, after all, voted against impeachment.PhotographAndy Meehan, above, a Trump loyalist who is trying to unseat Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, at left in 2019, in Pennsylvania's First Congressional District, at a rally this month.

But in announcing her vote on the verdict on Tuesday, she joined a growing chorus in her party who has argued that removing the president for his misconduct little more than nine months before he faces re-election was excessive.\"It is my judgment that except when extraordinary circumstances require a different result, we should entrust to the people the most fundamental decision of a democracy -- namely who should lead their country,\" Ms. Collins said.She said that Mr. Trump's call to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in which he asked for an investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., was \"improper and demonstrated very poor judgment,\" but said there had been \"conflicting evidence in the record\" about Mr. Trump's motivations.In an interview with CBS, Ms. Collins said she believed that Mr. Trump had \"learned from this case\" and that he will be \"much more cautious in the future.\" But the president has never acknowledged any wrongdoing, instead insisting his call with Mr. Zelensky was \"perfect.\"Ms. Collins's speech came as senators took turns on the Senate floor on Tuesday announcing how they would vote when they render a verdict on Wednesday in the third presidential impeachment trial in the nation's history.The bitterly divided Senate is all but certain to acquit Mr. Trump on both charges. It would take a two-thirds vote, or 67 senators, to convict and remove him, a threshold that neither side expects to materialize.Mr. Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 presidential campaign on his behalf, by withholding military aid and a White House meeting to lean on the country to investigate his political rivals. The impeachment trial was not formally meeting on Tuesday, before Mr. Trump's State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress. But their comments on Tuesday were the last opportunity for senators to explain their positions before voting on the verdict, and they appeared to be aimed at their constituents, their core supporters, and in some cases, the president himself.Here's a roundup of what other key senators said.McConnell blasts Trump's impeachment as 'dangerous.'Taking a victory lap for what he called the \"sober and stable Senate,\" Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, issued a stern rebuke of the House Democrats' case and strategy, casting it as a politically motivated attack that amounted to the \"most rushed, least fair and least thorough presidential impeachment inquiry in American history.\"\"Washington Democrats think President Donald Trump committed a high crime or misdemeanor the moment he defeated Hillary Clinton,\" Mr. McConnell said, referring to the president's victory in 2016. \"That is the original sin of this presidency: that he won and they lost.\"In his most detailed remarks on the impeachment managers' case to date, Mr. McConnell undercut an argument that the White House defense team had presented: that impeachment requires the violation of a criminal statue. But while Mr. McConnell said he did not subscribe to that legal theory, he condemned House Democrats all the same for sailing into \"new and dangerous waters.\"Schumer says the Senate trial 'fails the laugh test.'Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, spoke only briefly, to rebut what he called the majority leader's talking points.Defending the House managers' case as \"compelling,\" Mr. Schumer denounced Senate Republicans for blocking his motion to consider hearing from additional witnesses -- including John R. Bolton, the president's former national security adviser who had offered to testify -- and receive more evidence. The trial they created, he said, \"fails the laugh test.\"\"The Republicans refused to get the evidence because they were afraid of what it would show,\" Mr. Schumer said, \"and that's all that needs to be said.\"Ernst argues the voters should decide Trump's fateSenator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who is up for re-election in November, adopted an argument similar to one outlined by Mr. Trump's defense team on their final day of arguments: that to remove the president months before the election would be to subvert the will of voters.\"The House managers' arguments have argued that the American people cannot be trusted to render their own judgment on this president,\" Ms. Ernst said. \"I reject this premise, the complete distrust of the American people, with everything in my heart.\"Ms. Ernst did not directly address the president's conduct, but jabbed at House Democrats for trying to impose their own conventional wisdom onto how Mr. Trump conducted diplomacy. Foreign policy, Ms. Ernst said, is an \"art, not a science\" and \"trying to insert a formula into every presidential interaction with a foreign leader,\" she continued, was to veer onto a \"path towards ineffectiveness.\"Kaine laments 'a toxic president' who has infected the SenateSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, pledged to vote to remove Mr. Trump, and lamented the Senate's \"capitulation,\" a turn of events, he said, that surprised him.\"We have allowed a toxic president to infect the Senate and warp its behavior,\" Mr. Kaine said. \"And now the Senate's refusal to allow a fair trial threatens to spread a broader public anxiety about whether 'impartial justice' is a hollow fiction.\"Mr. Kaine, known in the Senate for his optimism, sounded a dark warning, insisting that an acquittal would only embolden Mr. Trump to engage in worse conduct. \"I will not be part of this continual degradation of public trust,\" he said.PhotographSenator Susan Collins, above, who is facing a steep re-election challenge in Maine, called President Trump's conduct \"wrong\" but said she would vote for acquittal. Senator Tim Kaine, right, said the Senate's \"capitulation\" would embolden Mr. Trump. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ANNA MONEYMAKER/THE NEW YORK TIMES; T.J.

As he flipped on the television Friday and watched how the story was being covered, that anger only mounted.Since taking office, Mr. Trump has searched for an attorney general who would function much as Roy Cohn did for him as his personal lawyer and fixer in the 1970s -- a warrior committed to protecting him and going after his foes. The president thought he had found that person in William P. Barr. But now, people close to Mr. Trump say, he is not so sure.The president was cheered this week when Mr. Barr moved to reduce the sentence of a convicted presidential friend, only to be shocked when the attorney general publicly called on Mr. Trump to stop tweeting about it. And after his livid reaction to the Justice Department's decision to drop a separate case, which he heard about without any advance notice, he learned that Mr. Barr was intervening more favorably on behalf of another presidential ally.The whipsaw events of recent days have bewildered much of Washington, including some of the people around the president and his attorney general. Once seen as a lock step partnership, it now may be the most complicated relationship in town. The six blocks between the White House and the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building have become a political buffer zone and no one can be entirely sure what comes next.Critics assume it is all a Kabuki dance, cynical theater meant to preserve Mr. Barr's credibility as he executes Mr. Trump's personal political agenda while pretending to look independent. And it is certainly true that, even now, Mr. Barr continues to demonstrate a willingness to personally take charge of cases with Mr. Trump's interests at stake.But insiders insist the tension is real, with potentially profound consequences for an administration that has redrawn the lines at the intersection of politics and law enforcement. Barely a week after being acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial, Mr. Trump is demanding that some of the people whose actions he believes led to his troubles be charged, convicted and sent to prison, and it is not clear that even Mr. Barr is willing or able to go as far as the president wants.In his only comment on the matter on Friday, Mr. Trump pushed back against Mr. Barr a day after the attorney general told ABC News that the president was making it \"impossible for me to do my job\" by tweeting about criminal cases and declared that he was \"not going to be bullied.\"Mr. Trump cited another comment Mr. Barr made in the same interview affirming that the president had never actually asked for any specific actions in a criminal case. \"This doesn't mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!\" Mr. Trump added. The \"so far\" in there, of course, hung online as a kind of sword of Damocles waiting to fall.Only in the hours after that tweet did the news emerge that Mr. Barr's department was dropping a case against Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director blamed by Mr. Trump for his role in the investigation into Russian election interference. Two people close to the matter said the Justice Department did not give the president a heads up about the decision.Then came the more welcome news for the Oval Office that Mr. Barr had ordered a re-examination of the case of Michael T. Flynn, the president's former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with Russia. The new review raised the question of whether Mr. Flynn will actually go to prison.Mr. Trump has bitterly decried \"what Flynn has gone through\" while believing that Mr. McCabe has unfairly walked, people close to him said. The president on Friday was angrier about the decision not to prosecute Mr. McCabe than he was at Mr. Barr's comments in his interview, the people said.Mr. Trump made no mention of any of those newer developments on Twitter or in several encounters with reporters before flying to Florida for the weekend. But he sometimes waits to publicly respond to such news until after an evening watching Fox News or hearing from friends.On the fifth floor of the Justice Department, Mr. Barr's team braced for what they feared would be a stream of critiques and humiliations from the president in what one predicted could be a death by a thousand cuts, not unlike what happened to the last attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who was tormented by the president after recusing himself from the Russia investigation.Mr. Sessions, like other cabinet members, stoically absorbed Mr. Trump's invectives, rarely standing up for himself or his employees, even as the president paralyzed, undercut and neutered him. Like other original cabinet members, he left the administration publicly humiliated and vastly diminished.Mr. Barr faced many risks in speaking out on ABC, according to people close to him. But he knew that no amount of public fealty would stave off a public drubbing or even an abrupt dismissal.For now, though, there is no expectation at the Justice Department or the White House of an escalation to that level. While Lou Dobbs on Fox Business Network excoriated Mr. Barr for rebuking the president, other Fox hosts who have Mr. Trump's ear, like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, were generally supportive of the attorney general. Tucker Carlson, another trusted television personality, treated Mr. Barr's ABC interview like a nonevent on his Fox News show Thursday night.Ms. Ingraham, who is close to Mr. Barr, said the attorney general was not breaking with the president but, in effect, reassuring him that the Justice Department's leadership would carry out Mr. Trump's wishes to clean up what they see as the corruption of his predecessor and that the tweets were neither necessary nor helpful.\"Barr was basically telling Trump, 'Don't worry, I got this,\"' Ms. Ingraham said on her show.Some of the attorney general's critics saw it the same way. Nine Democratic senators, including two presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent a letter to Mr. Barr on Friday calling on him to resign.His protestations of independence were not credible, they wrote, given his department's behavior. \"It demonstrates that you lied to Congress during your confirmation hearing when you stated that you would 'keep the enforcement process sacrosanct from political influence,' and it reveals your unwillingness or inability to maintain the integrity of the D.O.J. and to uphold justice and the rule of law,\" the senators wrote.Ms. Warren and three other Democratic senators also unveiled legislation barring an attorney general and other top Justice Department officials appointed by a president from participating in matters related to the president, his family or his campaign associates.Although Mr. Trump and Mr. Barr both said the president has not directly asked for any specific inquiries, the president has long pressured law enforcement officials both publicly and privately to open investigations into political rivals and to drop inquiries into him or his associates.Since Watergate, past presidents in both parties have had a tradition in place aimed at preventing political influence from the White House on Justice Department investigations, especially criminal inquiries that involved administration officials or friends of the president.\"It tries to prevent the interference by forcing all White House contact to go through a funnel at the top of the Justice Department,\" said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley who served in the Justice Department under President George W. Bush.Mr. Trump's first White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, issued similar rules in a Jan. 27, 2017, memo that prohibited White House officials from communicating with most Justice Department officials about \"ongoing or contemplated cases.\" Only the president, vice president or White House counsel was allowed to initiate such communications, Mr. McGahn wrote, and they must be directed to the attorney general or three other top Justice Department officials.\"In order to ensure that D.O.J. exercises its investigatory and prosecutorial functions free from the fact or appearance of improper political influence, these rules must be strictly followed,\" Mr. McGahn wrote.But scholars said Mr. Trump is right that he has the power to intervene if he chooses. Under Article II of the Constitution, any president has the authority to directly oversee criminal cases carried out by the Justice Department. There are no statutes that limit the contact between the White House and the Justice Department.\"The president can do what he wants,\" said Bruce Green, a law professor at Fordham University. \"His only restraints are self imposed. There are no legislative restraints.\"The only real recourse, he added, would be impeachment. \"If a president attempted to misuse the Justice Department and its criminal justice power for private ends, that's an abuse of power that is potentially impeachable,\" Mr. Green said. \"We can guess in 2020 how that would play out.\"Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Katie Benner and Michael Crowley from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump on Friday.

Conway III, are not shtick, friends say, and they are not having fun.WASHINGTON -- George T. Conway III has described the work of his wife, Kellyanne Conway, for President Trump in terms usually reserved for hostage situations: brainwashed by a cult, suffering from Stockholm syndrome, an overwhelmed mother protecting a destructive man-child.And if you think it's all shtick, some wink-and-nod act by a couple who fights by day and snuggles by night, planning a payday after Mr. Trump leaves the scene, think again, say some people close to America's oddest political couple.\"Those who think this is a 14-dimensional chess game are mistaken,\" said Rick Wilson, who with Mr. Conway and several other Republicans formed the Lincoln Project, an effort to beat Mr. Trump in the 2020 election.Mr. Conway \"has taken unequivocal and irreversible actions that have established his bona fides as someone who opposes Donald Trump, and she's going to be for Donald Trump until the last dog dies,\" he said, adding a question that many Americans have asked themselves about the Conways: \"Who knows the secrets of the human heart?\"In a sense, the passions in the Conway household have come to represent the societal agonies of the Trump era, a couple and a nation deeply divided, unsettled by the storms around the presidency, and asking themselves, when it's all over, can there be reconciliation?The Conways bring to mind a previous Washington \"It\" couple: Mary Matalin, who worked for President George Bush, and James Carville, the Democratic strategist who helped engineer President Bill Clinton's 1992 victory over Mr. Bush. Ms. Matalin and Mr. Carville turned their political dissonance into a lucrative brand, joking about their vast differences.The Conways agree politically on most things because Mr. Conway, for all his anti-Trump activities, remains deeply conservative. But the couple does not appear to be having much fun.\"Coming of political age in 1992 is significantly different than coming of age in 2017,\" Mr. Carville said. \"Trump people have much more of a sense of personal assault or grievance, and the Trump opponents have a high, high dose of doing the right thing for the country. You can hardly even tell jokes about it anymore.\"Ms. Conway, 53, Mr. Trump's senior counselor and 2016 campaign manager, has largely held her tongue about her husband, though she told The Washington Post in 2018 that his sniping \"disrespects his wife.\"In recent months, Mr. Conway, 56, a constitutional lawyer by trade and Trump opponent by conversion, has become more embittered, and more public. During the presidential impeachment, he took to CNN and Twitter as a commentator, calling Mr. Trump a \"criminal,\" \"pathological liar\" and \"Idiot-in-Chief.\"To mark Mr. Trump's acquittal by the Senate, Mr. Conway wrote a sarcastic, bitter column, concluding, \"I believe the president's call was perfect. I believe he is deeply concerned about corruption in Ukraine.\" Mr. Conway live-tweeted his derision as the president celebrated last week in the East Room of the White House. \"Let it out, @realDonaldTrump. Let it all out,\" he mocked.For someone who labored in Republican legal vineyards for decades -- in the 1990s, he was a lawyer for Paula Jones, who accused Mr. Clinton of sexual misconduct -- Mr. Conway did not cut much of a swath in Washington social circles. He rode his wife's coattails into the nation's capital.But of late, he has surpassed her on Washington's party circuit.\"She was the superstar for two and a half years, and now George is the superstar,\" said Sally Quinn, a journalist, author and Washington hostess who has been inviting Mr. Conway, but not Ms. Conway, to her parties in Georgetown.The Conways met in the summer of 1999, when Mr. Conway was a securities lawyer and partner at the New York firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Ms. Conway was a Republican pollster who appeared frequently on television. Mr. Conway told a mutual friend, the conservative commentator Ann Coulter, that he wanted to meet Ms. Conway, known then by her maiden name, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. The future Ms. Conway drove out to a Hamptons beach house, rented by Ms. Coulter, and the couple remained planted at the house's kitchen table, chatting for hours.They married in 2001 and moved into a Trump tower in Manhattan. Mr. Conway impressed the future president by taking his side in a condo board battle over removing the name \"Trump\" from the building, and he introduced Ms. Conway to Mr. Trump.Politics was less bruising then. In 2005, Ms. Conway teamed up with Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, to write a book about how American women were erasing political lines. By reputation, Ms. Conway was smart and empathetic, the type who remembered birthdays and weddings.The Conways now have four children: the twins, George IV and Claudia, 15; Charlotte, 11; and Vanessa, 10; and a pair of Corgis, Skipper and Bonnie, which Mr. Conway nicknamed Concerned and Troubled after the terms that Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has used to describe her reaction to Mr. Trump's behavior.Friends say the Conways are staying together for their children, although the couple is not always in the same city. Mr. Conway spent chunks of time last year in New York before leaving his firm, while Ms. Conway remained in Washington, where the Trump crowd has largely blackballed her husband.In November, Mr. Conway attended a \"Resistance\" party at the New York apartment of Molly Jong-Fast, an author and daughter of Erica Jong. The comedian Kathy Griffin posted a photograph on Instagram of Mr. Conway hiding coyly behind the liberal journalist Soledad O'Brien. Nearby were E. Jean Carroll, a writer who has accused Mr. Trump of rape, and the Hillary Clinton stalwart Philippe Reines.In Washington, Mr. Conway tends to hole up in his home office, writing opinion pieces and firing away on Twitter. In a July piece titled \"Trump Is a Racist President,\" he wrote about the first time he heard someone tell his mother, who emigrated from the Philippines, \"'Go back to your country.\"'The gulf between the Conways developed slowly before turning into a chasm. After Mr. Trump's victory, the Conways jumped into Washington with both feet, buying a 15,000-square foot house with eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. \"Kellyanne Conway Just Bought This $8 Million D.C. Mansion,\" blared Town & Country magazine, though Mr. Conway's legal partnership accounts for most of the couple's net worth of about $40 million.Mr. Conway wept for joy on election night and called his wife's achievement \"the best thing that ever happened to her.\" He turned down two potential posts in the Justice Department, calling the administration \"a dumpster fire,\" though he told the president at the time that he supported him.In those days, Ms. Conway went out alone, or with Adrienne Arsht, a philanthropist and arts patron with homes in Miami and across the street from the Conways. Ms. Arsht, who calls Ms. Conway \"a lovely neighbor, a great mother\" and \"a fabulous cook,\" played down their relationship.\"Our garages face each other, so why not go out together to save on emissions?\" she asked.Early on, Mr. Conway tweeted his disapproval of the president's tweets about the travel ban, then hastened to tweet his support for the president and \"my wonderful wife.\"In February 2019, at a British Embassy party for female members of Congress, Ms. Conway approached Ms. Quinn, the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd and the NBC News journalist Andrea Mitchell.\"It was like, 'Oh, I love your shoes and what a great bag, blah blah,\"' Ms. Quinn recalled, until she asked Ms. Conway about her husband, and Ms. Conway, she said, grew angry that Ms. Quinn had even brought him up. \"She just took off on all three of us,\" Ms. Quinn said. \"She really went crazy.\"\"I said, 'Kellyanne, you're married, and you're working for the president, and he's writing against the president,\"' Ms. Quinn recalled. \"'Guess what? This is a story.\"'The next month, the Conway marriage appeared to have become an issue in the White House. Mr. Trump had spent the weekend of March 16 retweeting conspiracy theorists and insulting Senator John McCain when Mr. Conway tweeted, \"His condition is getting worse.\"The next day, Brad Parscale, who now manages Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, tweeted that Mr. Conway \"hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success.\" The president piled on, \"A total loser!\"Mr. Conway then gave an interview to The Washington Post, saying that he tweets \"so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day.\" He added, referring to his wife, \"Frankly, it's so I don't end up screaming at her.\"Mr. Trump clapped back: \"George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife's success & angry that I, with her help, didn't give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!\"It fell to Ms. Conway to spin Mr. Trump's attacks on her spouse.\"He left it alone for months out of respect for me,\" Ms. Conway said of the president in an interview with Politico. \"But you think he shouldn't respond when somebody, a nonmedical professional, accuses him of having a mental disorder?\"Mr. Conway has not let up. In October, he used clinical terms in The Atlantic to say Mr. Trump's narcissism made him unfit for office.At Ms. Quinn's home recently, Mr. Conway and William F. Weld, the former Massachusetts governor and Mr. Trump's long-shot 2020 primary challenger, embraced like lost brothers, then posed for a photo with the former Democratic presidential candidate and self-help author Marianne Williamson.Mr. Conway \"was one of the last to leave,\" Ms. Quinn recalled. \"He was just glowing, you know?\"Kitty Bennett contributed research.PhotographKellyanne Conway, senior adviser to President Trump, with her husband, George, a day before the inauguration. Though he wept for joy on election night, his views on the president soon soured. Ms. Conway, right, has defended Mr. Trump's attacks on him.

Biden Jr. could not agree on what Moscow is, or is not, doing.Their disagreement came as intelligence officials disputed reports that emerged last week about a briefing of the House Intelligence Committee. The officials now maintain that the House members either misheard or misinterpreted a key part of the briefing, and that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not mean to say that it believes the Russians are currently intervening in the election explicitly to help President Trump.They do believe that Russia is intervening in the election, and that Moscow prefers Mr. Trump, a deal maker it knows well. But at least for now, those two objectives may not be linked.The differing interpretations only made it easier for the Trump administration and Democrats to put forward their own version of what the Russians are doing. As the national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, defended Mr. Trump and intimated that the Russians favored the Democratic presidential front-runner, Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden blamed the president and other Republicans for allowing Russia to continue to interfere in the election.Mr. O'Brien, who took office at the end of last summer, insisted on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that he had never seen any intelligence suggesting that the Russians were interfering on behalf of Mr. Trump.\"There's no briefing that I've received, that the president has received, that says that President Putin is doing anything to try and influence the election in favor of President Trump,\" Mr. O'Brien said, referring to the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin. \"We just haven't seen that intelligence. If it's out there, I haven't seen it.\"He was referring to an assessment provided to the House Intelligence Committee on Feb. 13. That briefing outlined the breadth of Russian efforts to get involved in the November election -- from hacking into voting systems to disinformation.At the root of the confusion is what Shelby Pierson, a senior intelligence official responsible for overseeing the issues of election interference, said in that briefing.Ms. Pierson, a longtime intelligence official, said there was no doubt the Russians were continuing to insert themselves in the election process. That would be consistent with past intelligence reports, and the effort by the United States Cyber Command in 2018 to block Russian intelligence from manipulating social media before the midterm congressional elections.But some intelligence officials said Ms. Pierson did not say that the current interference was explicitly on Mr. Trump's behalf. Others in the briefing said that in response to lawmakers' follow-up questions, officials made the connection between the Russian preference for Mr. Trump and Moscow's efforts to interfere in the election.The difference between actively backing Mr. Trump and preferring his re-election is a subtle nuance, officials say, but an important one: It is probably too early for the Russians to begin any significant move to bolster a specific candidate. In 2016, they at first sought to cause chaos and hurt Hillary Clinton, intelligence reports released later that year said, but only in the last few months before the election did they actively work to elect Mr. Trump.If they go the same route now, it would not be inconsistent with backing Mr. Sanders for the Democratic nomination, in part because Mr. Sanders has voted against new sanctions on Russia and because he is considered a noninterventionist. And they may conclude, rightly or wrongly, that Mr. Trump could beat Mr. Sanders.Mr. O'Brien seemed to have little doubt that the Russians preferred Mr. Sanders. \"What I've heard from the F.B.I.,\" he said, \"is that Russia would like Bernie Sanders to win the Democrat nomination. They'd probably like him to be president, understandably, because he wants to spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military.\"He did not give the source of that intelligence.Mr. Sanders has denounced Russia and warned it not to interfere in the election.Mr. Trump also leapt into the fray on Sunday, accusing Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of leaking information from the briefing.He demanded in on Twitter that someone tell \"Adam 'Shifty' Schiff to stop leaking Classified information or, even worse, made up information, to the Fake News Media.\"\"Someday he will be caught, & that will be a very unpleasant experience!\" Mr. Trump added.When Mr. Trump made similar comments earlier on Sunday, Mr. Schiff accused the president of deflection.\"Your false claims fool no one,\" he said in a tweet. \"You welcomed Russian help in 2016, tried to coerce Ukraine's help in 2019, and won't protect our elections in 2020. Now you fired your intel chief for briefing Congress about it. You've betrayed America. Again.\"Mr. Biden, who was in office as the Obama White House struggled over how to respond to Russian interference in 2016, saw some advantage in claiming he was the candidate Mr. Putin hated.\"The Russians don't want me to be the nominee,\" he said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook, and they've been taken down, saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running. They're not -- no one's helping me to try to get the nomination. They have good reason.\"Mr. Biden said he had not been informed of any specific intelligence. But intelligence officials say the reports they have generated have been consistent: Russian activity did not end with the 2016 election.Mr. Biden suggested that Mr. Trump was still denying Russia's involvement in 2016, even though American intelligence officials have testified on the issue every year of his presidency.\"The president denies they're involved,\" Mr. Biden said. \"They've been involved. I was deeply involved in the intelligence apparatus and how it functioned before we left the vice presidency. It was clear they were involved. The president continues to deny their involvement. It's overwhelming. And the fact is that everybody knows.\"He accused the Republican leadership in the Senate of failing to act to secure electoral systems.While Congress allocated several hundred million dollars for election security immediately after the 2016 election, gaping holes in the system remain, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has repeatedly blocked additional legislation from coming to the floor for a vote.PhotographRobert O'Brien said that Russia favors Senator Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee.

But in their own way, they have come up with a star witness they can bring to the floor: Mr. Trump himself.Barred at this point from presenting live testimony, the managers have offered up the president as the most damning witness against himself, turning his own words against him by quoting from his public remarks, citing accounts of private discussions and showing video clips of him making audacious statements that the House team argues validate its case.Thanks to screens set up in front of the senators, Mr. Trump's voice has repeatedly echoed through the Senate chamber the past three days. There he was on the South Lawn of the White House publicly calling on Ukraine to investigate a campaign rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. There he was calling on China to go after Mr. Biden, too. There he was declaring that he would willingly take foreign help to win an election. And there he was back in 2016 calling on Russia, \"if you're listening,\" to hack into Hillary Clinton's email.The strategy seeks to capitalize on Mr. Trump's astonishingly unfiltered approach to politics, which has led him again and again to say openly what other presidents with more of an understanding of the traditional red lines of Washington -- or at least more of an instinct for political self-preservation -- would never say in front of a camera.In effect, the managers are challenging the president's own penchant for announcing his motivations without apparent regard for whether it could get him into trouble. At the same time, the managers are challenging the senators to take Mr. Trump at his word about what really drove him to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Biden and other Democrats.While Mr. Trump's lawyers have argued that he was legitimately concerned with corruption in Ukraine when he held up nearly $400 million in security aid to that former Soviet republic, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California and the other House Democrats on the managers team have pointed to the president's own words to contend that he cared only about tarnishing his domestic rivals.In his presentation on Thursday, Mr. Schiff played about a half-dozen video clips of Mr. Trump, including one of the president on the South Lawn of the White House on Oct. 3 speaking with reporters who asked him what he was hoping to get Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to do when they talked by telephone on July 25.\"Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens,\" the senators saw Mr. Trump saying.\"So here we hear again from the president's own words what his primary object is,\" Mr. Schiff then told the senators, \"and his primary object is helping his re-election campaign, help to cheat in his re-election campaign.\"Mr. Schiff said Mr. Trump's own words made clear that he learned nothing from the Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \"He was at it again,\" Mr. Schiff said, \"unrepentant, undeterred, if anything emboldened by escaping accountability from his invitation and willful use of Russian hacked materials in the last election.\"Under the trial rules, the president's lawyers have had no chance to respond to their client's star turn on the Senate floor over the last two days, but they are poised to open their own case on Saturday and almost surely will argue that the managers have misinterpreted or twisted Mr. Trump's words. In the meantime, Mr. Trump's team has been left to defend him in the hallways during breaks.\"You're only hearing one side of the story here,\" said Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, one of a squadron of House Republicans enlisted by the president to serve as an adjunct of his defense team, working the cameras outside the chamber rather than the senators inside.Mr. Johnson said it was wrong to contend that Mr. Trump was not concerned about corruption in Ukraine and elsewhere around the world. \"Of course he was,\" Mr. Johnson told reporters. \"He's been talking about it as a central theme of his campaign before he was president. When he ran on the priority of America first, that's what he meant. He wanted to make sure that American taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.\"Mr. Trump is not the only person who has been presented to the Senate via video clips during the prosecution arguments, but even the other witnesses against him were largely drawn from his own team. Many of them testified during House hearings last fall about their concerns over the president and his allies pressuring Ukraine for help with his domestic politics.Among the prosecution's key witnesses are officials appointed by the Trump administration itself, including Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union; Kurt D. Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine; Fiona Hill, the president's former Europe and Russia adviser, and her successor, Tim Morrison; Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; William B. Taylor Jr., the former top diplomat in Ukraine; and Thomas P. Bossert, the former White House homeland security adviser.Others brought electronically into the chamber over the last three days include career public servants like Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine; Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a National Security Council staff member; and State Department officials like George P. Kent and David Holmes.\"Why did President Trump's own officials -- not so-called Never Trumpers, but public servants -- report this in real time?\" Mr. Schiff asked, referring to the mixing of politics with Ukraine policy. \"Because they knew it was wrong.\"Indeed, the managers used Mr. Trump's own appointees to rebut his assertion that he was right to push Ukraine to investigate its own supposed interference in the 2016 presidential election, a conspiracy theory that American intelligence agencies have called a Russian disinformation operation. The managers showed clips of Mr. Wray, Mr. Bossert and Dr. Hill all debunking the theory.But the most compelling voice in the chamber this week has been that of the president himself. In his three years in office, Washington has learned that when it wants to understand what Mr. Trump is doing or thinking, he will most likely spell it out in bracingly candid terms in front of a microphone or on Twitter -- and not always follow the official party line offered by his aides.That uninhibited style appeals to supporters who love that he does not hew to standard talking points, but it can make him a frustrating client for lawyers who would prefer he be more circumspect at the very least. Either way, it makes his statements more important in judging him. Which is presumably one reason his legal team has resisted Mr. Trump's suggestions that perhaps he should attend the trial and testify himself.Absent that, there will be the television clips and quotes from the rough transcript of his call with Mr. Zelensky and recollections of people like Mr. Sondland.Mr. Schiff played one clip after the other that he said exposed Mr. Trump's true intentions. In one, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"There was a lot of corruption having to do with the 2016 election against us. We want to get to the bottom of it.\"When the clip was shown, Mr. Schiff focused on the \"us\" in Mr. Trump's comment: \"What does that president say? Corruption against us. He is not concerned about actual corruption cases, only matters that affect him personally.\"But the managers had it easy the last couple of days with exclusive access to the microphone and the screens on the Senate floor, and unchallenged by either the White House legal team or the senators. On Saturday, the president's lawyers will have their chance to explain what Mr. Trump meant and provide the other side of the story, one that will interpret his words in a far different light than Mr. Schiff.Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lawyers, told reporters during a break on Thursday that the managers had presented nothing new and hardly proved their case.\"I saw nothing that has changed in the last day and a half, two and a half days, we've been going here,\" he said. \"We're going to begin a robust case when the Senate says it's time to start.\"PhotographRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, discussed notes with other House impeachment managers on Thursday.

Mr. Trump was particularly irritated that Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the leader of the impeachment proceedings, was at the briefing.During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump's allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he had been tough on Russia and that he had strengthened European security.Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying the conclusions could have been delivered in a less pointed manner or left out entirely to avoid angering Republicans. The intelligence official who delivered the briefing, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire and has a reputation for speaking bluntly.Though intelligence officials have previously told lawmakers that Russia's interference campaign was continuing, last week's briefing included what appeared to be new information: that Russia intended to interfere with the 2020 Democratic primaries as well as the general election.On Wednesday, the president announced that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and an aggressively vocal Trump supporter. And though some current and former officials speculated that the briefing might have played a role in that move, two administration officials said the timing was coincidental. Mr. Grenell had been in discussions with the administration about taking on new roles, they said, and Mr. Trump had never felt a kinship with Mr. Maguire.Spokeswomen for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and its election security office declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official called the Feb. 13 briefing an important update about \"the integrity of our upcoming elections\" and said that members of both parties attended, including Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee.In a tweet on Thursday evening, Mr. Schiff said that it appeared that Mr. Trump was \"again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling\" with his objections to the briefing.Mr. Trump has long accused the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's 2016 interference as the work of a \"deep state\" conspiracy intent on undermining the validity of his election. Intelligence officials feel burned by their experience after the last election, when their work became a subject of intense political debate and is now a focus of a Justice Department investigation.Part of the president's anger stemmed from the administration's reluctance to provide delicate information to Mr. Schiff. He has been a leading critic of Mr. Trump since 2016, doggedly investigating Russian election interference and later leading the impeachment inquiry into the president's dealings with Ukraine.Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Schiff would \"weaponize\" the intelligence about Russia's support for him, according to a person familiar with the briefing. And he was angry that he was not told right away about the briefing, the person said.Mr. Trump has fixated on Mr. Schiff since the impeachment saga began, pummeling him publicly with insults and unfounded accusations of corruption. In October, Mr. Trump refused to invite lawmakers from the congressional intelligence committees to a White House briefing on Syria because he did not want Mr. Schiff there, according to three people briefed on the matter.The president did not erupt at Mr. Maguire, and instead just asked pointed questions, according to the person. But the message was unmistakable: He was not happy.Ms. Pierson, officials said, was delivering the conclusion of multiple intelligence agencies, not her own opinion. The Washington Post first reported the Oval Office confrontation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Maguire, but not the substance of the disagreement.The intelligence community issued an assessment in early 2017 that President Vladimir V. Putin personally ordered a campaign of influence in the previous year's election and developed \"a clear preference for President-elect Trump.\" But Republicans have long argued that Moscow's campaign was intended to sow chaos, not aid Mr. Trump specifically.Some Republicans have accused the intelligence agencies of opposing Mr. Trump, but intelligence officials reject those accusations. They fiercely guard their work as nonpartisan, saying it is the only way to ensure its validity.At the House briefing, Representative Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah, who has been considered for the director's post, was among the Republicans who challenged the conclusion about Russia's support for Mr. Trump. Mr. Stewart insisted that the president had aggressively confronted Moscow, providing anti-tank weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russia-backed separatists and strengthening the NATO alliance with new resources, according to two people briefed on the meeting.Mr. Stewart declined to discuss the briefing but said that Moscow had no reason to support Mr. Trump. He pointed to the president's work to confront Iran, a Russian ally, and encourage European energy independence from Moscow. \"I'd challenge anyone to give me a real-world argument where Putin would rather have President Trump and not Bernie Sanders,\" Mr. Stewart said in an interview, referring to the nominal Democratic primary race front-runner.Under Mr. Putin, Russian intelligence has long sought to stir turmoil among around the world. The United States and key allies on Thursday accused Russian military intelligence, the group responsible for much of the 2016 election interference in the United States, of a cyberattack on neighboring Georgia that took out websites and television broadcasts.The Russians have been preparing -- and experimenting -- for the 2020 election, undeterred by American efforts to thwart them but aware that they needed a new playbook of as-yet-undetectable methods, United States officials said.They have made more creative use of Facebook and other social media. Rather than impersonating Americans as they did in 2016, Russian operatives are working to get Americans to repeat disinformation, the officials said. That strategy gets around social media companies' rules that prohibit \"inauthentic speech.\"And the Russians are working from servers in the United States, rather than abroad, knowing that American intelligence agencies are prohibited from operating inside the country. (The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security are allowed to do so with aid from the intelligence agencies.)Russian hackers have also infiltrated Iran's cyberwarfare unit, perhaps with the intent of launching attacks that would look like they were coming from Tehran, the National Security Agency has warned.Some officials believe that foreign powers, possibly including Russia, could use ransomware attacks, like those that have debilitated some local governments, to damage or interfere with voting systems or registration databases.Still, much of the Russian aim is similar to its 2016 interference, officials said: search for issues that stir controversy in the United States and use various methods to stoke division.One of Moscow's main goals is to undermine confidence in American election systems, intelligence officials have told lawmakers, seeking to sow doubts over close elections and recounts. American officials have said they want to maintain confidence in the country's voting systems, so confronting those Russian efforts is difficult.Both Republicans and Democrats asked the intelligence agencies to hand over the underlying material that prompted their conclusion that Russia again is favoring Mr. Trump's election.Although the intelligence conclusion that Russia is trying to interfere in the 2020 Democratic primaries is new, in the 2019 report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, there is a reference to Russian desires to help Mr. Sanders in his presidential primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016. The report quoted internal documents from the Internet Research Agency, a troll factory sponsored by Russian intelligence, in an order to its operatives: \"Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest except for Sanders and Trump -- we support them.\"How soon the House committee might get that information is not clear. Since the impeachment inquiry, tensions have risen between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the committee. As officials navigate the disputes, the intelligence agencies have slowed the amount of material they provide to the House, officials said. The agencies are required by law to regularly brief Congress on threats.While Republicans have long been critical of the Obama administration for not doing enough to track and deter Russian interference in 2016, current and former intelligence officials said the party is at risk of making a similar mistake now. Mr. Trump has been reluctant to even hear about election interference, and Republicans dislike discussing it publicly.The aftermath of last week's briefing prompted some intelligence officials to voice concerns that the White House will dismantle a key election security effort by Dan Coats, the former director of national intelligence: the establishment of an election interference czar. Ms. Pierson has held the post since last summer.And some current and former intelligence officials expressed fears that Mr. Grenell may have been put in place explicitly to slow the pace of information on election interference to Congress. The revelations about Mr. Trump's confrontation with Mr. Maguire raised new concerns about Mr. Grenell's appointment, said the Democratic House committee official, who added that the upcoming election could be more vulnerable to foreign interference.Mr. Trump, former officials have said, is typically uninterested in election interference briefings, and Mr. Grenell might see it as unwise to emphasize such intelligence with the president.\"The biggest concern I would have is if the intelligence community was not forthcoming and not providing the analysis in the run-up to the next election,\" said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former intelligence official now with the Center for a New American Security. \"It is really concerning that this is happening in the run-up to an election.\"Mr. Grenell's unbridled loyalty is clearly important to Mr. Trump but may not be ideally suited for an intelligence chief making difficult decisions about what to brief to the president and Congress, Ms. Kendall-Taylor said.\"Trump is trying to whitewash or rewrite the narrative about Russia's involvement in the election,\" she said. \"Grenell's appointment suggests he is really serious about that.\"The acting deputy to Mr. Maguire, Andrew P. Hallman, will step down on Friday, officials said, paving the way for Mr. Grenell to put in place his own management team. Mr. Hallman was the intelligence office's principal executive, but since the resignation in August of the previous deputy, Sue Gordon, he has been performing the duties of that post.Mr. Maguire is planning to leave government, according to an American official.Adam Goldman, Julian E. Barnes and Nicholas Fandos reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Eric Schmitt and David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographAmerican intelligence agencies concluded that Russia, on the orders of President Vladimir V. Putin, interfered in the 2016 election.

The verdicts came down -- after three weeks of debate -- almost entirely along party lines, with every Democrat voting \"guilty\" on both charges and Republicans uniformly voting \"not guilty\" on the obstruction of Congress charge.Only one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, broke with his party to judge Mr. Trump guilty of abuse of power.It was the third impeachment trial of a president and the third acquittal in American history, and it ended the way it began: with Republicans and Democrats at odds. They disagreed over Mr. Trump's conduct and his fitness for office, even as some members of his own party conceded the basic allegations that undergirded the charges, that he sought to pressure Ukraine to smear his political rivals.But in a sign of the widening partisan divide testing the country and its institutions, the verdict did not promise finality, which members of both parties conceded would come only after the November election.The president himself did not directly address his acquittal, but shortly afterward, he announced on Twitter that he would make a public statement on Thursday at the White House about what he called \"our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax.\" He then tweeted an attack ad against Mr. Romney that called the senator a \"Democrat secret asset.\"At the Capitol earlier in the day, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who presided over the trial, put the question to senators shortly after 4 p.m.: \"Senators how say you? Is the respondent, Donald John Trump, president of the United States guilty or not guilty?\"Seated at their mahogany desks, senators stood one by one to answer \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" to each of the two articles of impeachment.\"It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the said Donald John Trump be, and he is hereby, acquitted of the charges in said articles,\" declared Chief Justice Roberts after the second article was defeated.Democratic leaders immediately insisted the result was illegitimate, the product of a self-interested cover-up by Republicans, and promised to continue their investigations of Mr. Trump.\"The verdict of this kangaroo court will be meaningless,\" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said moments before the vote. \"By refusing the facts -- by refusing witnesses and documents -- the Republican majority has placed a giant asterisk, the asterisk of a sham trial, next to the acquittal of President Trump, written in permanent ink.\"The president's Republican allies excoriated Democrats for a proceeding they said had damaged the country and its institutions in the name of saving them.\"We will reject this incoherent case that comes nowhere near justifying the first presidential removal in history,\" said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.Yet at a news conference after the vote, Mr. McConnell declined several times to answer reporters who asked whether he considered Mr. Trump's actions appropriate.\"This decision has been made,\" Mr. McConnell said curtly. \"As far as I'm concerned, it's in the rearview mirror.\"As expected, the tally in favor of conviction on each article fell far below the 67-vote threshold necessary for removal. The first charge was abuse of power, accusing Mr. Trump of a scheme to use the levers of government to coerce Ukraine to do his political bidding. It did not even garner a majority vote, failing 48 to 52, with Mr. Romney voting with the Democrats. The second article, charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of Congress for an across-the-board blockade of House subpoenas and oversight requests, failed 47 to 53, strictly on party lines.Like this one, the trials of Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton also ended in acquittal -- a reflection of the Constitution's high burden for removing a chief executive.But in a stinging rebuke of the country's leader aimed at history, Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said that Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine was \"the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.\" Though he voted against the second article, Mr. Romney became emotional on the Senate floor in the hours before the verdict on Wednesday as he described why he deemed Mr. Trump guilty of abuse of power, calling it a matter of conscience. He was the first senator ever to vote to remove a president of his own party.\"I am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters,\" Mr. Romney said. \"Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?\"Mr. Romney's defection, which he announced a couple of hours before the final vote, was a stark reflection of the sweeping transformation of the Republican Party over the past eight years into one that is now dominated almost entirely by Mr. Trump. And it deprived the president of the monolithic Republican support he had eagerly anticipated.Still, the White House declared victory.\"Today, the sham impeachment attempt concocted by Democrats ended in the full vindication and exoneration of President Donald J. Trump,\" said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary. \"As we have said all along, he is not guilty.\"Mr. Trump's re-election campaign moved quickly to capitalize on the moment, distributing a fund-raising email declaring, \"Sorry haters, I'm not going anywhere.\"Several Republican senators ultimately acknowledged the heart of the House case -- that Mr. Trump undertook a concerted pressure campaign on Ukraine to secure politically beneficial investigations into his rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., using nearly $400 million in military aid as leverage.But most argued that the conduct was not sufficiently dangerous to warrant the Senate removing a president from office for the first time in history -- and certainly not with an election so near. Others dismissed Democrats' arguments altogether, insisting their case was merely an attempt to dress up hatred for Mr. Trump and his policies as a constitutional case.Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two Republican swing votes who have tilted against the president in the past, both voted against conviction and removal. And two Democrats from traditionally conservative-leaning states, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, voted to convict Mr. Trump, denying him the bipartisan acquittal he coveted.Although the verdict was never in doubt, Democrats lobbied to expand the scope of the Senate trial to include witnesses and documents that the president refused to provide during the House inquiry, working to pressure vulnerable Republicans facing challenging re-election contests, like Ms. Collins, to join them or risk being portrayed as beholden to Mr. Trump. All but two Republicans refused, making the trial the first impeachment proceeding in American history to reach a verdict without calling witnesses.As they closed their case, the seven Democratic House managers who prosecuted it warned that Mr. Trump would emerge only emboldened in his monarchical tendencies and that those who appeased him would be judged harshly by history. Republicans, they said, had chosen to leave the president's future up to voters despite evidence that he had tried to cheat in the election, and would continue to do so.Seldom used in American history, impeachment is the Constitution's most extreme mechanism for checking a corrupt or out of control officeholder. In unsheathing it, Democrats took on political risk that could backfire in November on their presidential nominee or their incumbents in Congress, including moderates in conservative districts and states where Mr. Trump is popular.At least one Democrat, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, glancingly acknowledged that his vote to convict would most likely contribute to his loss this fall in deeply conservative Alabama.\"There will be so many who will simply look at what I am doing today and say it is a profile in courage,\" Mr. Jones said before the vote. \"It is not. It is simply a matter of right and wrong.\"For now, the impeachment of Mr. Trump appears to have evenly divided the nation. Public opinion polls suggest that even though a growing number of Americans agreed that the president most likely abused his office and acted improperly, more than a slight majority never agreed that he should be removed from office.If Mr. Trump's standing among the public has been hurt by the trial, it is not yet evident. To the contrary, the latest Gallup poll, released on Tuesday, showed that 49 percent of Americans approved of his job performance -- the highest figure since he took office three years ago. The same survey showed that Republicans' image has improved markedly, with 51 percent viewing them favorably compared with 43 percent in September.The possibility of impeachment has hung over Mr. Trump's presidency virtually since it began, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, initially resisted it. After Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia's election interference in 2016 and possible collaboration with the Trump campaign, found 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, she said impeachment was too divisive a remedy to pursue.Her calculations changed in September with the emergence of an anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower that accused the president of marshaling the powers of government to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and a theory that Democrats had colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 election. In authorizing the impeachment inquiry, Ms. Pelosi tasked the House Intelligence Committee to investigate the scheme and build a case.Mr. Trump issued a blanket directive to all government agencies not to comply with the inquiry, robbing investigators of key witnesses and facts that could have filled out their case, and ultimately giving rise to the obstruction of Congress charge.Still, more than a dozen administration officials came forward, offering testimony in private and then in scintillating public hearings that confirmed and expanded on the whistle-blower complaint. On Dec. 18, the House impeached Mr. Trump on both counts.To protect his Senate majority as much as the presidency, Mr. McConnell promised a swift acquittal -- and he delivered it. It was just 20 days from the time the articles of impeachment were first read on the Senate floor to Wednesday's vote. By comparison, the Clinton trial in 1999 lasted five weeks, and in 1868, the Senate took the better part of three months to try Johnson.The final shift in defenses by all but the most conservative of Mr. Trump's allies came last week, when The New York Times reported the first in a series of articles revealing that in August, Mr. Trump told John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, that he would not release the military aid for Ukraine until the country helped out with investigations into Mr. Biden and other Democrats.Impeachment was seriously contemplated for a president only once in the first two centuries of the American republic; it now has been so three times since the 1970s, and two of the past four presidents have been impeached.Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane, Catie Edmondson, Patricia Mazzei, Michael D.

Here's what they had to say.MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG Former mayor of New York City, 77 Mr. Bloomberg's surprise entry in November shook up the Democratic race. A billionaire media executive who served three terms as mayor of New York City, Mr. Bloomberg is running as a business-minded centrist with a record of advocacy on issues like gun control and climate change. PETE BUTTIGIEG Former mayor of South Bend, Ind., 38 Mr. Buttigieg has framed his candidacy around themes of generational change and center-left policy proposals. He has stressed his identity as a gay military veteran who is not yet 40 years old, and urged Democrats not to imperil the general election by running too far to the left. AMY KLOBUCHAR Senator from Minnesota, 59 A three-term senator, Ms. Klobuchar has been campaigning as a Midwestern moderate with a left-of-center agenda on issues such as health care and business regulation. Pointing to her electoral record in Minnesota, she has been making the case that she is uniquely equipped to win states like Wisconsin and Michigan. TOM STEYER Former hedge fund executive, 62 A former hedge fund investor from California, Mr. Steyer is a major bankroller of Democratic causes, first focusing on climate change and more recently on the impeachment of President Trump. He has repeatedly explored running for office, but this is the first time he has actually become a candidate. ELIZABETH WARREN Senator from Massachusetts, 70 A former law professor-turned-senator, Ms. Warren entered the 2020 race with a reputation for battling Wall Street and has structured her candidacy around a detailed and wideranging progressive policy agenda. She has made the case that only a candidate pledging \"big, structural change\" can win the general election. ANDREW YANG Former tech executive, 45 Mr. Yang, a former technology executive, has emerged from political obscurity to build a substantial following around his proposal to establish a government-guaranteed monthly income for all Americans.The New York Times reached out to nine Democratic presidential candidates to ask them the same set of questions on video. Seven accepted the invitation. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey was interviewed in December, but has since dropped out of the race. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont declined to participate. Most of the candidates visited the studio in our New York City office. We traveled to Los Angeles for two interview sessions. The interviews took place between Dec. 10 and Jan. 22. During the sessions, we asked candidates for a terse, direct reply before explaining their views at greater length. How would you handle a general-election debate against President Trump? Voters often bring up how they imagine different candidates faring against Mr. Trump. This question was intended to get the candidates to talk explicitly about how they would approach that challenge. In every case, they said they would not seek to fight fire with fire, but instead harry the president in a way that would undercut the foundations of his political strength. Number one, don't waste your time criticizing him and telling everybody what he's done wrong. People know that. Tell them what you're going to do right. I think Donald Trump is not the right person for the job. I said, so at the Democratic convention back in 2016. The key to dealing with President Trump in a debate is to deny him his ability to change the subject. This is going to take a huge amount of discipline. And obviously he will do things that you have to respond to or deal with when he lies. You have to correct the lie. We are the ones with the right answer. And as the nominee, knowing that the American people will agree with me on most of the issues, I will summon the discipline to deny this president his famous power to change the subject. The most important thing is to keep focusing on an optimistic economic agenda for this country because he is the king of distraction. He loves to take things as he does when he governs in places, which really, when you step back, aren't the things that people are thinking about in their everyday lives. The second is to not go down every rabbit hole with him. And the third is to use humor back at him and to sort of point out some of the absurdities. I don't think you can put up with him bullying you. And I don't think you can put up with his lies. I think you've got to be very aggressive in terms of saying how he's lying, how he's incompetent. I think the big thing is to be yourself and not let him bully you. The first rule is you never back down from a bully. I'm not letting the guy get behind me and I'm not backing off. But the other half is, I'm not making a debate all about Donald Trump. We got to get out there and talk about the reason to vote for a Democrat. We got to get out there and make our case. You know, the Trump show -- he's going to keep running it. And frankly, I think a lot of people are getting either tired or scared of that show. I cannot wait to debate Donald Trump, in large part because I believe I would make him seem totally ridiculous. I would use humor and defuse some of his more blatant misstatements and untruths. I am laser-focused on many of the same problems that got Donald Trump elected in 2016. The fact that we blasted away four million manufacturing jobs and many communities never recovered. The fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation in our country's history and more and more Americans are being left behind. Do you think the next administration will need to investigate President Trump or members of his family? Nearly every Democratic candidate we interviewed left the door open to investigations. But they suggested they would defer to the Justice Department on how to handle Mr. Trump and his family. There is no argument that when it's over, we don't need the continued chaos. On the other hand, I hate to see somebody who did something wrong go without being called to account for it. That's a ways down the road. The first thing we should focus on right now is having the Republican-led Senate do its job and conduct an investigation after Pelosi sends the articles of impeachment over. I view this as a process that is separate from what's going on in the Oval Office. The less that things like criminal prosecution have to do with politics, the better, and it's why I will trust the Department of Justice to think for themselves to enforce the law and to do it without political interference one way or the other from me. It's not the administration that does the investigation. It's prosecutors, and they should be free from political interference. That is up to the attorney general and the Justice Department. All I know is that I will put very good people in to run that department that will make decisions about all kinds of cases. I think it's going to be really important that we have a president that gets the difference between the Justice Department and the president, and that the job of lawyers at the Justice Department is to make decisions about cases. It is not the job of the president. I don't think there's any question but that Mr. Trump has broken the law. I think that Michael Cohen is in jail for some actions that he took at the behest of Mr. Trump. I think that that's a legal question for the Justice Department. But I imagine that he's aware that he's going to be investigated, because people have gone to jail for doing things that he asked them to do. Equal treatment under the law. I believe that's still the law of the land unless it's been revoked while we've been sitting here talking. Yes. I believe that we should have Justice Department that's willing to investigate lawbreaking. Nobody is above the law, not even the president of the United States, not even the family. The law is the law. And we have a Justice Department that's there to say, \"Equal justice under law means it applies across the board to everybody. I think it's a very bad pattern to fall into where the administration of a government investigates the previous administration. We've seen this pattern play out in developing countries around the world where the new president throws the former president in jail, in part because they want to eliminate a rival. It's much more of an American tradition to try and move the country forward and unify around the new president. And that would be the direction I would prefer. What is the most important thing foreign leaders should know about you? Some of these candidates are relatively well known abroad. Most of them are not. We wanted to know how they would introduce -- or reintroduce -- themselves on the world stage. Nearly all the candidates stressed their honesty and candor. That Bloomberg is honest, Bloomberg is smart, Bloomberg cares and has a worldview. My record has been out there -- 12 years in City Hall. Everybody knows what I stand for; everybody knows what my abilities are. And everybody knows what I did. Not everything worked. But I think in looking back, a vast majority of the things that the team that I put together did work. That I will keep my word. Our allies and our adversaries should expect a United States that will govern based on our values, that will participate in the international community in leading other nations to tackle big problems, and to uplift those values, from human rights and democracy to freedom of the press. That I am someone that actually likes to be with people. I think they also need to know that I am a person of trust, that I keep my threats and keep my promises, which I think we need in a foreign leader. And that's something that President Trump has been wrong on. I am a fair partner. But I am a resolute representative of the American people. I can be a trusted partner, but you have to be in return a trusted partner to me. That I am what I appear to be. I am the daughter of a janitor who got a chance in life to do what I most wanted to do: become a public school teacher. And I got that chance because of a commuter college that cost $50 a semester and opened one door for me and then another. That what moves my soul is opportunity, that I believe in the good that we can do together as a people, as a government, when we invest in opportunity. That I want to find common ground and rebuild our historic partnerships and alliances. To me, the Trump administration will be seen as a one-term aberration, and the rest of the world will know that America's open for business to solve problems that concern everyone. Do you see Saudi Arabia as a U.S. ally? The American relationship with Saudi Arabia is under historic strain, as a result of Saudi human rights violations, a brutal war in Yemen and the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Every candidate expressed some level of concern about the American relationship with the Saudis, though some were more pointed than others. Saudi Arabia is certainly a key to us keeping peace in the Middle East. I think some of the things that I see in Saudi Arabia -- Khashoggi thing is just inexcusable. On the other hand, it is a country that's trying to change and become more Western. And if you talk to women in Saudi Arabia, they would say they're getting more rights. But we have to have relationships. We have a lot of military commitments there and a lot of allies on the military side. Saudi Arabia has been considered an ally. But they're also an example of how the disappearance of U.S. leadership has resulted in bad behavior. Saudi Arabia needs to hear the message that from things like the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi to the civil war in Yemen and the atrocities and humanitarian catastrophe that we've seen there, that the United States expects more from our allies. The United States certainly looks to Saudi Arabia as an ally, but they are testing the boundaries of that friendship. They are an ally in many ways, but that doesn't mean that you don't call them out when they do something really horrific. The killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a newspaper journalist at an American newspaper, was killed and dismembered. They did that. And I think that the president should have been much firmer in how he responded. And of course, you can see it in my record, where I voted against the arm sales and their activity in Yemen. We have a complicated relationship with Saudi Arabia. I believe that as someone who puts climate as my No. 1 priority, we're going to have to have a different relationship with Saudi Arabia going forward. I would consider them currently an ally. And I would believe that it's possible that we'll work together. But as someone who puts climate at the forefront of my No. 1 priority, this is the country with the biggest oil reserves in the world. And, you know, we cannot afford to develop all the fossil fuels in the world, period. I think we have to think hard about our relationship with Saudi Arabia. The war in Yemen, the fact that the Saudis clearly have not only undermined a free press but killed a journalist solely because he questioned authority. This, this really raises issues about our relationship with the Saudis and makes me very uneasy about the way that, in the Trump administration, we've continued to support them and continued arm sales. I think it's a real problem. We have had an alliance in relationship with Saudi Arabia for years, but it's unacceptable for an ally to dismember a journalist the way that they did. So if that's the sort of behavior of an ally, we need to re-examine that relationship and let the world know that there are serious consequences for these kinds of actions.Does the United States have a role to play in Hong Kong? The democracy movement in Hong Kong has been one of the most important news stories in the world over the last year. With few exceptions, the candidates said the American president should be a public champion of democratic values, including in Hong Kong. It doesn't seem that there's any easy solution to satisfy everybody. But I think the People's Republic should work very hard. It would be a big loss to the world and to China if Hong Kong was not a stable commercial hub. I think it is so charged, you'd have to do a backdoor, quietly, make the Chinese understand what your views are. But the people of Hong Kong certainly don't need us weighing in and increasing the tension. Those who are rising up in Hong Kong demanding democracy deserve to know that they have a friend in the United States of America. And it is shameful that they have not heard a peep of even moral support from the American president. I stand with those who are seeking a better life. And I want those who are there in Hong Kong to know that in the future, when I'm president, the United States will encourage their rightful aspirations to live in peace, prosperity and democracy. Yes, the United States should be a beacon of democracy around the world, and we should be reasserting American values. And I am very glad that we passed a bill to allow for sanctions against China when it comes to how they handled Hong Kong. I would also add how they horrifically handled the Uighurs and that they've literally taken people from their homes and put them in modern-day work camps. The U.S., as part of a coalition of democracy- and freedom-loving countries, has a role to play standing up for the rights of people in Hong Kong. We have a very complicated relationship with China. It goes across multiple vectors. It's our most important foreign relationship right now, and it will be our most important foreign relationship going forward in that context. We have a responsibility to make it clear that we believe in democracy and the rights of the people in Hong Kong. Yes. And that role should have started when the protests first began in Hong Kong. Standing up for people who are protesting for their democratic rights, I think we ought to be standing up for that all around the world. That ought to be a big part of who and what America stands for. I lived in Hong Kong for a semester. I still have family there, and when I see the scenes that are taking place, it's jarring and almost incomprehensible. We have to do all we can to stand up for the rights of the people in Hong Kong, people who are protesting for self-determination and democracy, recognizing, though that Hong Kong is in a gray area diplomatically. It's a semiautonomous region of China. So we have to approach it with that in mind. What is the most urgent economic challenge facing the United States? Unless a recession takes hold in the coming months, Democrats are likely to be campaigning next fall against an incumbent who is personally unpopular but presiding over a steady economy and low unemployment. But they all have critiques of President Trump's economic record, and in some cases the underlying health of the economic system. Too many people are left out of this economy. Partly it's income inequality, but partly it's lack of opportunity. We've got to make sure that people get the kind of education and the abilities to move up that everybody should have. If people can't see a future that's better for themselves and their children, they're not going to be happy, and they have a right to be upset. The most urgent economic challenge today is that people aren't being paid enough. Among the many complex things that we have to pay attention to in our economy, some of them are abundantly simple. And the biggest on my mind is making sure that Americans' incomes increase. It's why when I'm president, the No. 1 measure of economic performance will not be the G.D.P. It will be the income growth of the 90 percent. Shared prosperity. The problem that while people may have jobs, they can't afford things. It's really hard for them to afford, say, their prescription drugs. Well, there's a good reason for that. And the prices have been skyrocketing. And we have a president that made them a bunch of promises and haven't done anything about it. It's the inequality in income that people face. The distribution of the income of the United States is shockingly unfair. The most urgent is the corruption. Until we beat back the influence of money on decision-making in Washington, of campaign contributions and lobbying money and bought-and-paid-for experts, we can't make the changes we need to make. We've had 40 years of trickle-down economics. And it's been a complete disaster for everyone except the rich. We're going through the greatest economic and technological transformation in our country's history, and it is leaving millions of Americans behind. We blasted away four million manufacturing jobs that were primarily based in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa, all swing states that Donald Trump needed to win and did win. Would it be important to you to get Republican support for your agenda? There are deep differences between the candidates on policy and ideology. One of the most important practical disagreements is over the value of bipartisanship: whether it is more of an occasional necessity for governing or a genuine virtue for its own sake. I think there's no question that you have to bring this country together. The Republicans and the Democrats in the Senate office building don't even share bread; they don't sit at the same table. We need both sides to pass legislation. You want as much support as you can get from every source for every policy you put forward. The good news is on issues ranging from economic fairness to even gun reform, there's a majority of Americans that includes lots of Republicans who agree that we have to take these steps. Yes, because I am all about winning big and bringing people with me. I think one of the key focuses of this campaign should be to bring people with me, not shut them out. And that is what I've done in all my elections. So that's how you govern as well. It's been well over a decade since Republicans deigned to compromise with Democrats. So as far as I'm concerned, what we really need to do is make sure that the people of the United States are on our side, that that's actually the way we're going to get things done. Two of my three brothers are Republicans. I reached out to Republicans pretty much every day. And I want to bring as many people on board as I can. But let's be clear, the most important thing is we make the changes we need to make. The way we're going to make real change is we're going to build a grass-roots movement across this country. And we're going to take back control of our government and make it work not just for rich folks -- make it work for everyone. My campaign is drawing in thousands of Trump voters, independents, libertarians, and Republicans as well as Democrats and progressives, because I'm not ideological, and people can sense I'm just about trying to improve our way of life. I think it is important to draw in Americans from every part of the political spectrum to solve the problems that face us all. Do you think Barack Obama made any mistakes as president? Democratic candidates have shown little to no interest in reassessing the Obama administration. We wanted to know if any of the candidates would admit to thinking the Obama administration had any flaws at all. While all of them swathed their answers in lavish praise for the Obama record, several offered revealing hints of criticism. Everybody makes mistakes all the time. I'm sure he would not say that he didn't make mistakes. Over all, I think he had a reasonably successful presidency. And he certainly came out with his reputation intact, which is the most important thing that he probably thinks about and he should. I think where the president could have done more, perhaps, was in appointing judges at the very beginning, although I'm sure he had some reasons to why it took so long. It's easy with the benefit of hindsight to point to things that should have been different. Of course, there was unfinished business, more work to do around inequality, immigration and beyond. But we should also recognize what was achieved in those eight years. Every president makes mistakes, but I admire the Obama presidency as one of the greatest in modern times. I always think of Barack Obama. And I think we don't know what we've got till it's gone. If there's one thing that really I wish I would have done and he would have done, it would be to push the pharmaceutical issue as part of the Affordable Care Act. That was an opportunity and I know there was some resistance within the Democratic Party. But I think, over all, when historians look back at Barack Obama record, they do now and they will then consider him a great president. I think Barack believed that he were, if he was decent, honest, a good -- an honest broker -- that Republicans would compromise with him. He's not perfect. He was very good, but he's not perfect. I thought he trusted the Republicans too much, too long. And it shows what a good person he is and that he has a high estimation of human nature. It just turned out he trusted some people who never compromised with him and never traded fairly with him. There are no two people who agree on everything. But President Obama faced an extraordinary crisis in this country -- an economy that at the time he took over was just hurtling over a cliff and on its way down, down, down -- and he turned that around. Every time I think of Barack Obama, I think of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, because he stood up for that agency, and he's how we got it passed into law. And that agency has forced giant financial institutions to return more than $12 billion. It's hard to play armchair quarterback when the entire economy was at stake. But I believe the biggest missed opportunity was in the wake of the financial crisis. When we had a fundamental choice to either recapitalize the banks or keep Americans in their homes, we chose the banks, we bailed out Wall Street to the tune of $4 trillion. And to me, there was a real missed opportunity that in some ways we have not yet recovered from. What is the last book you read? Presidential candidates have so little time or mental energy for anything besides the campaign. We were wondering what kind of reading they do in the free time they have. \"Catastrophe 1914\" by Max Hastings. Story of World War I. Fascinating book. In one year we went to war, and the war never changed for the next four or five years. There was no reason to go to war, and it was lack of leadership, and we can't let that happen again. I just finished a book by Seneca. It was a very short book with his commentary on the shortness of life. He says life is plenty long as long as you know how to live it, something like that. And with all the noise going on right now, it's a good time to go back to the Stoics. I am reading now \"Desk 88,\" which is the book of my colleague Sherrod Brown, and it's an incredibly beautifully written book, where he goes through the history of his desk, and all the people that had it before him and carved their names into the desk, which includes Robert Kennedy. The first senator who had the desk was Hugo Black, who was of course later appointed by F.D.R. to the U.S. Supreme Court and was a major player in the New Deal. The last book I finished, which I think was the day before yesterday, is called \"The Good Assassin.\" And it's a study on American involvement in Cuba around the end of the Batista regime and when Castro was just taking over. I just finished Malcolm Gladwell's \"Talking to Strangers.\" He puts together all these different studies from different areas in order to tell stories about what's gone wrong when strangers talk to each other. The story he starts with and the story he ends with is the story of Sandra Bland, and what went wrong in the communications between Sandra Bland and the police officer. And the whole book is a cautionary tale. That was really interesting. I read a book called \"Project Drawdown\" about ways that we can reduce carbon emissions and help get us down to zero.PhotographWord count: 4651Show lessYou have requested \"on-the-fly\" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Roberts Jr. to preside over the proceeding.In a somber ceremony that initiated only the third presidential impeachment trial in the nation's history, Chief Justice Roberts vowed to act \"according to the Constitution and the laws.\" He then administered the same, 222-year-old oath of impartiality to the senators, setting in motion the final stage of a process that has roiled Congress and could shape the outcome of the 2020 elections, along with Mr. Trump's legacy.Even as the ritual unfolded in the chamber, with senators signing their names one by one in an oath book near the marble Senate rostrum, new evidence was emerging about Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine that is at the heart of the charges against him.A trove of texts, voice mail messages, calendar entries and other records handed over by Lev Parnas, an associate of the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, offered additional detail about the scheme. And the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan federal watchdog, found that Mr. Trump's decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine, which the House charges was part of his pressure campaign, was a violation of the law.In Ukraine, officials announced Thursday that they had opened a criminal investigation into \"possible violations of Ukrainian law and of the Vienna Convention\" by allies of Mr. Trump's after documents from Mr. Parnas suggested that his associates had conducted surveillance on a United States ambassador while she was stationed in Kyiv.While Thursday's ceremony was dictated by tradition and senatorial courtesy, Mr. Trump's trial promises to be an unpredictable affair, as Democrats press their case for removing a Republican president they argue abused his power and obstructed Congress.Mr. Trump is almost certain to be acquitted in the Republican-controlled chamber, but even the president's allies were divided on Thursday about how best to defend him in a trial with heavy political stakes, some pushing for a quick dismissal and others staying open to calling witnesses who could offer new information.At the White House, Mr. Trump sought to distance himself from Mr. Parnas and raged about the trial, telling school prayer advocates that impeachment was a \"hoax\" fabricated by his enemies. The president called Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House impeachment manager, a \"corrupt person.\"His comments came hours after Mr. Schiff strode across the Capitol, flanked by the six other House prosectors, to present the articles of impeachment to a Senate chamber hushed by the sergeant-at-arms, who shouted, \"Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye,\" to bring the trial to order.Mr. Schiff read aloud the charges against Mr. Trump, accusing the president of a scheme to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election for his own benefit by pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals, withholding $391 million in military aid and a White House meeting as leverage, and then by trying to conceal his actions from Congress.\"President Trump,\" Mr. Schiff said, \"warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.\"Later, the president used Twitter to express his outrage.\"I JUST GOT IMPEACHED FOR MAKING A PERFECT PHONE CALL!\" he wrote, apparently referring to the July phone call in which he asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to \"do us a favor\" and investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden.As the public debate intensifies, the arcane rules of impeachment trials require the senators to remain virtually silent throughout the proceedings -- on \"punishment of imprisonment,\" according to the text -- for hours on end, six days a week, as the world watches.The televised trial will play out against the backdrop of the president's re-election campaign and in the shadow of the Democratic Party's nominating contest, scheduled to begin with the Iowa caucuses in less than three weeks. Never in modern history has a president been the subject of an impeachment trial in an election year, adding to a sense of uncertainty in both parties.Four Democratic candidates for president -- Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael Bennet of Colorado -- sat quietly in their seats on Thursday for the start of a trial that is likely to keep them off the campaign trail for much of the time before the Feb. 3 caucuses.\"I would rather be in Iowa today,\" Mr. Sanders said, noting the coming caucuses and the contests soon to follow in New Hampshire and Nevada. \"But I swore a constitutional oath as a United States senator to do my job and I'm here to do my job, and I think the people of the United States understand that.\"Less than an hour before the impeachment charges were read, the Senate performed one last bit of legislative business, giving final approval to Mr. Trump's revised North American trade deal. The vote sent the overwhelmingly bipartisan trade pact to the president's desk for his signature, handing Mr. Trump a victory as the trial began.Only hours later, in its first official action as a presidential impeachment court, the Senate issued a summons formally notifying Mr. Trump that he was on trial for high crimes and misdemeanors, and giving him and his legal team until Saturday evening to respond in writing. Senators gave the president's lawyers and the House managers who will prosecute the case the weekend to file trial briefs laying out their arguments for and against conviction.Then Chief Justice Roberts adjourned the trial until Tuesday, banging the Senate's small ivory gavel and clearing the way for arguments to begin next week.Behind the scenes, Republicans were divided over how to proceed, with moderates and conservatives at odds over whether to try to dismiss the case altogether, as Mr. Trump has suggested he would like and some of his staunchest allies are eager to do.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, was drafting trial rules that would not guarantee a vote to do so, rankling some conservatives but potentially sparing moderates a politically risky move. And in another bow to centrists who have insisted on it, Mr. McConnell was planning to allow votes on whether to call witnesses after opening arguments from both sides and questions by senators.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said Thursday that she would be inclined to vote in favor of new testimony at that point.\"While I need to hear the case argued and the questions answered, I tend to believe having additional information would be helpful,\" she said in a statement. \"It is likely that I would support a motion to call witnesses at that point in the trial, just as I did in 1999.\"The issue will be hotly debated when the trial resumes Tuesday, and the Senate is scheduled to vote on the rules for the proceeding.Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said he would immediately call for a vote to subpoena witnesses and documents that could provide new information about Mr. Trump's actions. Democrats have said the new evidence from Mr. Parnas proves that the Senate should press for documents that the administration refused to provide during the House investigation.The evidence provided by Mr. Parnas adds significant detail to the public record about how the pressure campaign played out and new political peril for Mr. Trump as his lawyers seek to exonerate him. On Wednesday, Mr. Parnas told The New York Times that he believed the president knew about the efforts to dig up dirt on his political rivals.Representative Val B. Demings, Democrat of Florida and one of the seven impeachment managers, tweeted Thursday that the assertions by Mr. Parnas confirmed that Mr. Giuliani and others were \"working on the presidents orders.\"Democrats have also demanded that the senators hear from John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Robert Blair, a top aide to Mr. Mulvaney; and Michael Duffey, a top budget official.But Mr. Schumer's motion is all but certain to fail. Mr. McConnell has said he has the votes to open the trial without promising witnesses, and will take up the matter later.Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary, said the White House expected Mr. Trump's formal response to the impeachment charges would prove he did nothing wrong, and she dismissed the stream of new details emerging about the Ukraine pressure campaign.Aides said Mr. Trump was not watching the pomp and circumstance happening at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, although the White House postponed the event he had scheduled with school prayer advocates until after the televised oath-taking was over.If he had tuned in, Mr. Trump would have seen an elaborate ritual that fulfilled one of the few constitutional requirements for an impeachment trial, that senators and the chief justice of the United States take a special oath that dates to 1798.On Thursday, it was administered to Chief Justice Roberts by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the longest-serving Republican.\"Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?\" Mr. Grassley read.\"I do,\" the chief justice replied before delivering the same oath to the senators.Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Annie Karni and Adam Liptak.Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Anni Karni, and Adam Liptak.PhotographChief Justice John G.

He turned a prayer breakfast into a launching pad for political attacks and then staged a long, rambling venting session at the White House where he denounced \"evil\" and \"crooked\" lawmakers and the \"top scum\" at the F.B.I. for trying to take him down.Mr. Trump's team indicated that his desire to turn the tables on his foes may go beyond just tough language. The White House press secretary declared that Democrats \"should pay for\" impeaching the president, and the Trump administration worked to facilitate a Senate Republican investigation of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the goal of Mr. Trump that was at the heart of his impeachment.\"It was evil,\" Mr. Trump said of the investigations that led to his Senate trial in an hourlong stream-of-consciousness address to supporters in the East Room of the White House, tossing aside the more calibrated text prepared by his staff. \"It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars, and this should never ever happen to another president, ever. I don't know that other presidents would have been able to take it.\"Democrats showed little sign of backing down either. House Democrats have already said they are likely to resume their investigation into Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to incriminate the Bidens, while a Senate Democrat on Thursday called for an inquiry into whether the administration covered up related information by improperly classifying it.Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who sat just feet from Mr. Trump as he questioned her faith during the annual National Prayer Breakfast, later pushed back against his implication that she was disingenuous for saying she prayed for him. Some of his remarks, she said, were \"particularly without class\" and \"so inappropriate at a prayer breakfast.\"She also suggested that Mr. Trump appeared to be on medication during his State of the Union address on Tuesday. \"He looked to me like he was a little sedated,\" she told reporters. \"Looked that way last year, too.\"Mr. Trump's vituperative performance on Thursday was the diametrical opposite of how President Bill Clinton responded to his own acquittal after a Senate impeachment trial in 1999. On the day he was cleared of charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, Mr. Clinton appeared alone in the Rose Garden, said he was \"profoundly sorry\" and called for \"reconciliation and renewal.\"His Republican opponents at the time were just as eager to move on, feeling burned after losing seats in midterm elections and watching not one but two of their House speakers step down. One important difference is that Mr. Clinton was in his second term, while Mr. Trump is seeking re-election in a campaign framed in part by the impeachment debate.For Mr. Trump, the Senate's rejection of the two articles of impeachment against him on Wednesday was marred by the fact that Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, was the only senator to break rank, joining every Democrat in voting to convict Mr. Trump for abuse of power.Angry at Mr. Romney's defection, Mr. Trump waited a day to appear in person with supporters in the East Room in a ceremony that veered between celebration and confrontation.Mr. Trump held up a copy of The Washington Post to show its banner headline, \"Trump Acquitted,\" then reviewed the long litany of investigations against him over the last three years, dismissing them as partisan efforts to stop him from serving as president.\"We first went through Russia, Russia, Russia,\" he said, mocking the investigations into the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf and ties between his campaign and Moscow. \"It was all bullshit,\" he said, the first time he or any president has been known to use that profanity in a formal event on camera in the East Room, according to Factba.se, a research service.The talk included a greatest-hits string of attacks on some of Mr. Trump's top villains, including the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey (\"that sleazebag\"), his onetime deputy Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok (\"two lowlifes\"), the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, as well as Hunter Biden, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.He called Ms. Pelosi \"a horrible person,\" Mr. Romney \"a failed presidential candidate\" who used \"religion as a crutch\" and Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House manager, a \"corrupt politician.\"The president thanked his lawyers and congressional Republicans, praising them one by one for their support. In particular, he highlighted Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader and his most important defender in the Senate. \"You did a fantastic job,\" Mr. Trump told him.He called out more than a dozen other Republican defenders, including Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader; Jim Jordan of Ohio; Mark Meadows of North Carolina; and Elise Stefanik of New York. Noticeably absent, and unmentioned by the president, were Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer at the center of the Ukraine pressure campaign, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of his most outspoken allies.\"This is sort of a day of celebration, because we went through hell,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But I'm sure they'll try and cook up other things,\" he added of the Democrats, \"because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do -- in my opinion, it's almost like they want to destroy our country. We can't let it happen.\"In the wake of Mr. Trump's acquittal, Republican senators pressed their inquiries into Hunter Biden's finances, seeking to prove that the president was right to insist that Ukraine investigate him and the former vice president.A spokeswoman for Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the Treasury Department had readily complied with a request by the Republican majority for documents related to Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine, contrasted with the administration's refusal to provide papers for the House impeachment inquiry.For their part, Democrats were still seeking investigations, too. Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut asked the Government Accountability Office to review whether the Trump administration misused classification power to hide information about the president's Ukraine pressure campaign. And House Democrats have already said they will probably subpoena John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, to ask about Ukraine.Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said Democrats should be made to answer for what she called a dishonest attack on Mr. Trump. \"Maybe people should pay for that,\" she said on Fox News. Asked to elaborate, she equated Mr. Trump with the United States. \"People should be held accountable for anything they do to hurt this country and this president,\" she said.Mr. Trump's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast was as overtly political as any president has delivered at the annual event, traditionally a bipartisan affair marked by talk of faith and common ground. He triumphantly held up newspapers reporting his acquittal, cited rising stock markets, boasted about his approval rating and urged the audience to vote in the fall.Mr. Trump's speech followed a keynote address by Arthur Brooks, a Harvard professor and prominent conservative thinker, who called on Americans to \"love your enemies.\" At one point, Mr. Brooks asked the audience, \"How many of you love somebody with whom you disagree politically?\" Hands around the room shot up. \"I'm going to round that off to 100 percent,\" he said. But Mr. Trump did not raise his hand.\"Contempt is ripping our country apart,\" Mr. Brooks continued. \"We're like a couple on the rocks in this country.\" Without directly mentioning Mr. Trump, Mr. Brooks added: \"Ask God to take political contempt from your heart. And sometimes when it's too hard, ask God to help you fake it.\"Mr. Trump made no effort to fake it. \"Arthur, I don't know if I agree with you,\" he said when he took the microphone. \"I don't know if Arthur is going to like what I'm going to say.\"He then launched into his grievances. \"As everybody knows, my family, our great country and your president have been put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people,\" he said.Without naming them, Mr. Trump singled out Mr. Romney and Ms. Pelosi. \"I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong,\" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Romney. Then, referring to Ms. Pelosi, he said, \"Nor do I like people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that's not so.\"It was the first time the speaker and the president had appeared together since the State of the Union address, when Mr. Trump refused to shake Ms. Pelosi's hand before his speech and she ripped up her copy of his speech after he gave it. When Ms. Pelosi gave a short talk at Thursday's breakfast about the poor and persecuted, Mr. Trump refused to look at her, glowering with undisguised antipathy.By the end of his own speech at the prayer breakfast, Mr. Trump recognized that his message did not fit the love-your-enemies theme. \"I apologize. I'm trying to learn,\" he said. \"It's not easy. It's not easy. When they impeach you for nothing, then you're supposed to like them? It's not easy, folks. I do my best.\"At a news conference later at the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi dismissed Mr. Trump's comments. \"I don't know if the president understands about prayer,\" she told reporters, but said she prays \"hard for him because he's so off the track of our Constitution, our values.\"\"He really needs our prayers,\" she added. \"He can say whatever he wants. But I do pray for him.\"Reporting was contributed by Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Alan Rappeport, Michael Crowley and Maggie Haberman.PhotographPresident Trump on Thursday claimed vindication, and one by one lauded the lawmakers who helped him in the impeachment case.

As a consolation prize, the president named Mr. Mulvaney a special envoy for Northern Ireland.Mr. Trump's decision to push out Mr. Mulvaney came as the president confronted a coronavirus outbreak that has unsettled much of the country, threatened the economy and posed a new challenge to his re-election campaign. But the decision was seen as a long-delayed move cleaning up in the aftermath of the Senate impeachment trial as he shuffles his inner circle for the eight-month sprint to Election Day.In taking over the White House, Mr. Meadows, 60, a retiring Republican from North Carolina, becomes Mr. Trump's fourth chief of staff in 38 months, the most that any president has had in such a short time. His arrival almost surely signals more changes to follow, as most of Mr. Mulvaney's deputies and others on his team are expected to leave, too, possibly including Emma Doyle, his top lieutenant, and Joe Grogan, the domestic policy adviser.Hope Hicks, one of Mr. Trump's most trusted advisers, returns on Monday in a new role working for Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Mulvaney, who technically retained his post as budget director while serving as acting chief of staff, will surrender that, too, and the acting director, Russell T. Vought, appears poised to take the job permanently, an appointment he has quietly lobbied for for months.The change has been a long time coming. The president soured on Mr. Mulvaney a while ago but was warned by advisers not to get rid of him until after his Senate trial, which ended with Mr. Trump's acquittal on Feb. 6. Throughout the impeachment battle, Mr. Mulvaney was at near-open war with the White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone, at one point seen as a potential successor as chief of staff.Mr. Mulvaney had increasingly been on the losing side of policy battles and appeared less often at Mr. Trump's side. Some saw a sign of impending dismissal last month at the wedding of Stephen Miller, the president's senior adviser, and Katie Waldman, the spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Trump sat with Mr. Meadows and his wife along with other advisers at one table, while Mr. Mulvaney was left at a lower-tier table, according to a witness. Wedding guests whispered about the optics of the scene, right in front of so many people.Mr. Trump called Mr. Meadows on Thursday to offer him the job, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Mr. Mulvaney, who took an annual trip to Nevada this week, learned of the decision on Friday, another person familiar with the events said. Mr. Mulvaney did not travel with Mr. Trump to Florida; instead, he sent Ms. Doyle.The president wanted to announce the news on Twitter earlier in the day, but ended up waiting until after a day of travel to Tennessee to survey tornado damage and to Georgia to tour the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to another person close to the situation. Some aides assumed he would therefore wait until Sunday and were taken off-guard at the Friday night tweet.The replacement was widely seen in the West Wing as a chance for the president to reinvigorate his staff, over which Mr. Mulvaney was seen as losing control. Some of the president's conservative advisers, including Fox News hosts, had been pressing him to replace Mr. Mulvaney.In Mr. Meadows, Mr. Trump will have an ally he considers a confidant and bellwether of congressional conservatives. \"I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. At a closed-door fund-raiser on Friday evening, he told donors that Mr. Meadows would be \"my James Baker,\" according to a person in the room, referring to the chief of staff to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Mr. Baker is generally considered the gold standard in the post.In a statement of his own, Mr. Meadows praised Mr. Mulvaney for doing \"a great job,\" adding, \"This president and his administration have a long list of incredible victories they've delivered to the country during this first term, with the best yet to come.\"A founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Mr. Meadows has been one of the president's most ardent defenders. For months during the impeachment battle, Mr. Meadows was a ubiquitous face on television arguing forcefully that the president had done nothing wrong, appearances that cemented his relationship with Mr. Trump.First elected in 2012, Mr. Meadows announced in December that he did not plan to seek re-election, hinting at the time that he might work for Mr. Trump in some capacity. \"My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,\" he said.Mr. Mulvaney, 52, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, served as chief of staff for more than 14 months in an \"acting\" capacity without ever formally being given the title. Mr. Mulvaney brushed off the snub by telling people that everyone in Mr. Trump's White House was effectively in the job on an acting basis, but the seeming lack of faith or respect invariably made it harder for him to impose authority.Witnesses placed Mr. Mulvaney at the heart of the events that led to Mr. Trump's impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to incriminate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney carried out Mr. Trump's order to suspend $391 million in aid to Ukraine, an action declared illegal by the Government Accountability Office. Some advisers later told the president that Mr. Mulvaney had helped ensnare him in impeachment, even though he was following Mr. Trump's wishes.At a news briefing in October, Mr. Mulvaney contradicted the president's denial that he had imposed a quid pro quo on the assistance to benefit his own political fortunes. Mr. Mulvaney told reporters that the White House had withheld aid to Ukraine in part to force Kyiv to commit to investigating a widely debunked theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 presidential election on behalf of the Democrats, a story that American intelligence agencies have called Russian disinformation.\"Absolutely. No question about that,\" Mr. Mulvaney said. He added, \"That's why we held up the money. \"Later that afternoon, Mr. Mulvaney issued a written statement trying to take it back, denying any quid pro quo between the aid and the investigation.The conflicting statements bolstered Democratic critics and dismayed Republican defenders, who were relying on his assurances that the aid suspension was not tied to his demands that Ukraine investigate Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney defied a House subpoena to testify, but House managers prosecuting Mr. Trump in the Senate played his comments from the briefing repeatedly as part of their case.Fiona Hill, a former White House aide, told House investigators last fall that Mr. Mulvaney had been involved in arranging a White House visit for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that was tied to whether he would conduct the investigations sought by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. She testified that Mr. Mulvaney was working with Gordon D. Sondland, who was then the ambassador to the European Union.John R. Bolton, then the president's national security adviser, was alarmed at the machinations and ordered Ms. Hill to report the matter to a White House lawyer. \"I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\" Mr. Bolton told her to tell the lawyer.Unlike his predecessor John F. Kelly, a retired Marine general who left in late 2018, Mr. Mulvaney made a point of not trying to control the famously mercurial president and instead let Trump be Trump. Mr. Kelly said in October, as the House was pursuing its Ukraine inquiry, that he had previously warned the president that such an approach would mean that \"you will be impeached.\"As Mr. Trump's first budget director, Mr. Mulvaney helped enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, the president's signature legislative victory, and rolled back environmental and other regulations. But he was frustrated in his attempts to pare back spending and wound up presiding over a period of rocketing budget deficits that are projected to top $1 trillion a year for the next decade.During Mr. Mulvaney's time as acting chief of staff, the economy remained strong, and by the end of his tenure, Mr. Trump's approval rating had risen to 49 percent in Gallup's poll, the highest of his presidency. He made a point of using Camp David to build ties with lawmakers and aides who otherwise previously felt neglected.Mr. Mulvaney recently told an audience in Britain that he regularly conflicted with the president over various decisions but made a point of keeping that private. \"I disagree with the president every single day,\" he said. \"You just don't hear about it -- that's not my job.\"Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman from New York, and Annie Karni, Katie Rogers, Michael D. Shear and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington.PhotographRepresentative Mark Meadows, left, a stalwart defender of the president, will take over for Mick Mulvaney, above, who will become a special envoy for Northern Ireland.

Mr. Trump's defenders, denouncing the case against him, said he had done nothing wrong and should be judged by voters.Making their closing arguments from the well of the Senate, the House managers and the president's lawyers invoked history and the 2020 presidential campaign as Democrats and Republicans prepared to take the fight over Mr. Trump's fate to the broader public arena. Neither side expected to change the outcome of the final vote on Wednesday, when the Senate is all but certain to acquit the president, largely along party lines.The Democratic impeachment managers, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, warned that Mr. Trump had tried to rig the 2020 election in his favor -- by withholding military aid from Ukraine in an effort to pressure the country to investigate his political rivals -- and had put a blot on the presidency that would stain those who failed to stand up to him. Calling the president \"a man without character or ethical compass,\" Mr. Schiff insisted that now was the time for members of his own party to choose between normalizing corruption or removing it.\"Truth matters to you. Right matters to you,\" Mr. Schiff said, making a case aimed at Republicans. \"You are decent. He is not who you are.\"Casting the impeachment managers' case as shoddily constructed, the president's defense team issued a scathing indictment of the House Democrats' argument, contending that removing Mr. Trump from office would subvert the will of the electorate and fundamentally alter the functioning of the separation of powers. Their final word sounded as much like a campaign pitch as a legal defense.\"This is an effort to overturn the results of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election that begins today in Iowa,\" said Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, speaking only hours before voting began in the caucuses there. \"The only appropriate result here is to acquit the president and to leave it to the voters to choose their president.\"In an awkward confluence of events, Mr. Trump will have an unimpeded platform to make his own final case on Tuesday, when he is to deliver his annual State of the Union address from the floor of the very House that impeached him in December.The abbreviated closing arguments constituted the substantive end of Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, the third such proceeding in American history. In a mark of just how entrenched both sides were in their positions, senators skipped a period of deliberation and instead made their way to Senate floor one by one to announce their positions ahead of Wednesday's final vote on the House's abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges. In 1999, the Senate spent three days weighing President Bill Clinton's fate during his impeachment proceeding.One moderate Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, broached the idea on Monday of censuring Mr. Trump after the trial concludes, a largely symbolic gesture that he said could attract bipartisan support.\"His behavior cannot go unchecked by the Senate,\" Mr. Manchin said, \"and censure would allow a bipartisan statement condemning his unacceptable behavior in the strongest terms.\"But given the stark polarization in the chamber -- where most Republicans are reluctant to criticize Mr. Trump and Democrats are almost uniformly in agreement that he should be removed for his behavior -- there was no serious discussion of that option.Despite the president's lawyers' frequent references to the Iowa caucuses, few senators needed a reminder of the political calendar. Just after the arguments concluded, three senators sitting in judgment of Mr. Trump who are running for the Democratic presidential nomination -- Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- raced to catch planes back to the Midwest for rallies. A fourth, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, traveled to New Hampshire, which will hold the 2020 race's first primary next week.So far, the senators who have stated their decisions on acquittal or conviction have lined up along party lines, with Democrats echoing the House managers as they announced support for conviction and Republicans insisting the president's removal was unsupportable on varied grounds.\"Simply asserting -- at least 63 times -- that their evidence was quote unquote overwhelming doesn't make the House of Representatives' allegations proven or an impeachable offense,\" said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the longest serving Senate Republican, on Monday as he announced his acquittal vote.But several moderate Republicans and Democrats, whose votes could swing against their parties, had yet to declare their intentions. It would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate -- 67 senators -- to convict and remove Mr. Trump, an outcome that appeared far out of reach. Still, the president is eager to be acquitted by a bipartisan vote and to avoid the spectacle of having even one Republican vote to convict him.Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, another potential swing vote, announced that she would vote to acquit Mr. Trump, while also taking jabs at both parties for devolving in a partisan brawl and calling the president's conduct \"shameful and wrong.\"\"His personal interests do not take precedent over those of this great nation,\" Ms. Murkowski said. But, she added, \"the response to the president's behavior is not to disenfranchise nearly 63 million Americans and remove him from the ballot.\"Mr. Manchin said he was still undecided.Monday's closing remarks made evident just how far apart the two sides remained after two weeks of heated arguments before the Senate. They disagree not only on how to interpret the facts of the case, but on what actually constitutes an impeachable offense, too. Lawyers for the president advanced a theory rejected by most scholars that neither abuse of power nor obstruction of Congress met the definition of high crimes and misdemeanors.The House managers insisted that they had compiled a mountain of evidence capped by new disclosures by John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, that Mr. Trump had acted corruptly and with his own interest in mind when he conditioned nearly $400 million of military aid to Ukraine and a meeting at the White House on investigations into his political rivals.Mr. Schiff portrayed it as part of an insidious pattern of conduct -- dating to Mr. Trump's embrace of Russian election interference on his behalf in 2016 -- that continues to put the country at risk.\"The short, plain, sad, incontestable answer is no, you can't, you can't trust this president to do the right thing,\" Mr. Schiff said. \"Not for one minute, not for one election, not for the sake of our country. You just can't. He will not change, and you know it.\"Mr. Trump then tried to shield himself and hide his wrongdoing from the public and Congress, the managers said, by mounting a defiant campaign of obstruction, blocking witness after witness from testifying while refusing to produce a single subpoenaed document.\"We know what the president did and why he did it. This fact is seriously not in doubt,\" said Representative Sylvia R. Garcia, Democrat of Texas. \"Senators on both sides of the aisle have said as much. The question for you now is, does it warrant removal from office? We say yes.\"Mr. Trump's lawyers condemned the impeachment managers' case as a hastily thrown together partisan enterprise, noting that the only bipartisan vote in the House was in opposition to impeachment.\"This is exactly and precisely what the founders feared,\" said Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers. \"This was the first totally partisan presidential impeachment in our nation's history, and it should be our last.\"Mr. Trump's defenders vigorously denied that he withheld the military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with the nation's president as leverage for investigations into his political rivals, dismissing ample evidence to the contrary. But their claims were narrowly tailored, carefully skirting the new disclosures from Mr. Bolton.Taking aim at the second article of impeachment, charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of Congress, Patrick Philbin, the deputy White House counsel, upbraided the House for jumping \"straight to the ultimate nuclear weapon of the Constitution.\" The president, he said, was empowered by decades of precedent to stonewall the House's subpoenas, and to assert otherwise would be \"antithetical to the proper functioning of the separation of powers.\"The dueling arguments were a prelude to the senators' final vote, capping the five-month impeachment drama.Michael D. Shear, Patricia Mazzei and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographJay Sekulow, a lawyer for President Trump, condemned the \"totally partisan impeachment.\" Representative Adam B.

Mr. Trump commuted her sentence in June 2018, after the reality television star Kim Kardashian West personally appealed to the president on her behalf. Ms. Johnson had been serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction.Even before the ad, Ms. Johnson was already something of a touchstone for Mr. Trump, who invited her to attend his State of the Union address last year and highlighted her story in his speech. But elevating the administration's work on criminal justice reform to Super Bowl status was another effort by Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to reach black voters.The Johnson ad was made late last year and was tested with focus groups months in advance, aides said. Mr. Trump himself made edits to the spot and ultimately settled on it as the \"most impactful\" of a flight of ads he was given to choose from in the days leading up to the Super Bowl, people familiar with the process said.Mr. Trump was not wrong: Salesforce data indicated that online, the ad featuring Ms. Johnson was the most talked about one of the game, and that most of the chatter around it was positive.But privately, several senior Trump aides expressed skepticism of Mr. Kushner's belief that broad numbers of black voters, whose views of the president are overwhelmingly negative, are persuadable. Running an ad aimed at black voters -- which could also have the effect of reassuring white suburban women, a worrisome demographic for the campaign, that the president is not racist -- was a change of strategy from Mr. Trump's previous efforts to simply energize and turn out his base.Many public polls back up the skeptics in Mr. Trump's orbit. According to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll released last month, for instance, more than 80 percent of black respondents said that they believed Mr. Trump was racist and that he had helped to make racism a bigger problem in the country. Nine out of 10 black Americans in the poll said they disapproved of Mr. Trump's job performance.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Mr. Trump himself was a motivating factor for turning out African-American Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections. Voter participation among black people in 2018 grew from the 2014 midterms, according to data from the Pew Research Center.Despite those numbers and the skepticism from colleagues, Mr. Kushner has been advising Mr. Trump that black voters can be converted into supporters if they are simply educated on his policies. Mr. Trump's biggest challenge, Mr. Kushner has told people, is a \"knowledge gap\" on many of the president's accomplishments, particularly on the issue of criminal justice reform, which Mr. Kushner has spearheaded.Mr. Kushner has hosted black leadership summits at the White House. And two of the lone African-American White House staff members, Scott Turner and Ja'Ron Smith, have been traveling to black communities to make a pitch for Mr. Trump.Even some of Mr. Trump's most vociferous Republican critics said it was not an off-the-wall idea, although Mr. Trump had only a thin record to run on and a political career marked by racial invective and a proposed Muslim ban to run from.\"They don't need to reinforce the base at this point,\" said William Kristol, the conservative writer and prominent \"Never Trump\" Republican. \"If they can chip away a little bit at the African-American vote, or make it harder to mobilize them against Trump, it's not a foolish expenditure of money.\"Mr. Kushner has pointed people to public polls, including Rasmussen, that are outliers but that have shown Mr. Trump winning up to 30 percent of the African-American vote. In 2016, Mr. Trump won just 8 percent of the black vote, according to exit polls.But Mr. Kushner has told people that in Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, they faced a candidate who had been popular in the black community for decades, while Mr. Trump was then an unknown quantity. In 2020, Mr. Kushner has argued, voters need to be reminded of the president's accomplishments and that their \"worst fears have not been realized.\"Mr. Trump's goal is finding a way to shave off enough supporters from the Democratic nominee to compensate for an expected loss of suburban voters in swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said that in three states that were key to Mr. Trump's victory -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- even a small change could matter.\"Given how close many states were, but actually the three Rust Belt states that put him in the White House, any little bit helps at the margins of any demographic group,\" Mr. Ayres said.Mr. Trump has professed bafflement that his numbers with black voters are not higher, telling allies he assumed he would fare better because the economy is doing well and unemployment among African-Americans has dropped.Cornell Belcher, a progressive pollster whose firm worked on President Barack Obama's campaign and who is black, described the efforts by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner as laughable. \"It's almost as if they think we're all kin to each other,\" he said, adding that passage of the First Step Act, the criminal justice bill that Mr. Trump signed in 2018, \"does not erase this man's record of just absolute, over-the-top racist rhetoric and policies that frankly hurt African-American communities.\"The campaign's decision to use the Super Bowl as an opportunity to expand its coalition of voters is a change from how Mr. Trump was positioning himself less than two years ago.For years, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized National Football League players who took a knee when the national anthem was played before games, a form of silent protest against social inequality and police brutality. He directed Vice President Mike Pence to walk dramatically out of an N.F.L. game in Indianapolis in 2017 when a group of football players knelt during the anthem.At the time, his political advisers noted that the fight with N.F.L. players like Colin Kaepernick was not some distraction, but the essence of Mr. Trump's re-election strategy: enmeshing himself in culture wars and heightening racial tensions as a method to fire up his political base.Jessica Jackson Sloan, the national director of #Cut50, a prisoner advocacy group, said the ad was helpful to her work on the state level, regardless of any political advantage Mr. Trump was trying to achieve.\"We've heard many times what happened to this country when the Republican candidate for president was playing Willie Horton ads,\" Ms. Sloan said, referring to an infamous ad in the 1988 presidential race that highlighted the story of a black man who had raped a white woman and assaulted her husband while free on a prison-furlough program supported by Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate.\"Regardless of what reasons he did it,\" she added of Mr. Trump, \"the fact we have a sitting Republican president campaigning on criminal justice reform is 180 degrees from where we've been in the past. It's really going to help us with some of these Republican state legislatures.\"The Trump campaign did not announce the subject of the ad until after Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor running for president as a Democrat, unveiled his own ad, which featured an African-American mother grieving the loss of her son to gun violence.Mr. Trump had said he would air a 60-second ad during the Super Bowl, and previewed a generic ad showcasing his economic accomplishments. But what played during the game was a 30-second spot featuring Ms. Johnson, followed by a 30-second one afterward about the president's economic record.Mr. Trump's campaign emphatically denied making any decision in reaction to Mr. Bloomberg. \"He had nothing to do with it,\" said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. \"How we would use our 60 seconds was always an internal decision based on no outside factors.\"Reached on the phone, Ms. Johnson declined to say when she learned the ad in which she appears would run.PhotographThe Super Bowl commercials this year included a 30-second campaign advertisement for the president featuring a black former convict named Alice Marie Johnson.

Past Republican presidents might have been inclined to attend, but either on the advice of staff or their own instincts saw it as a step too far and instead showed their support in less visible ways, like through remote messages or by meeting with activists.Mr. Trump, who once called himself \"very pro-choice,\" has until now addressed the group only remotely and welcomed some marchers at the White House.But as he has battled for political survival in the face of multiple investigations and a re-election campaign, he has made increasingly warm overtures to evangelicals and sought to cast himself as the most firmly anti-abortion president in at least a generation.His administration has already embraced the march, which draws thousands of attendees, in unprecedented ways. In 2017, Mike Pence became the first sitting vice president to attend the event, and the next year, Mr. Trump became the first president to address the rally by video. In his speech, the president vowed that his administration would \"always defend the very first right in the Declaration of Independence, and that is the right to life.\"Many of the evangelical Christians who most strongly oppose abortion find Mr. Trump's two divorces, penchant for profanity and lack of demonstrated interest in religion before he entered politics to be unsettling. But as a political bloc, they have stood by him loyally as he hands them long-sought judicial appointments and policy changes.In a statement, Jeanne Mancini, the president of March for Life, praised the president for appointing anti-abortion judges, cutting taxpayer funding for abortions in the United States and abroad, and outspokenly opposing late-term abortions.\"President Trump and his administration have been consistent champions for life,\" she said, \"and their support for the March for Life has been unwavering.\"Mr. Trump's announcement comes a few days after the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion political action group, announced that it would spend $52 million to support the president and other Republican candidates in the 2020 election cycle, a sum the group called a record.The group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, a former chairwoman of the 2016 Trump campaign's Pro-Life Coalition, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's attendance at the March for Life \"signals a watershed moment for the pro-life movement.\"The March for Life, which has its headquarters in downtown Washington, says its mission is to \"promote the beauty and dignity of every human life by working to end abortion -- uniting, educating, and mobilizing pro-life people in the public square.\"On Twitter, Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called the president's announcement \"a desperate attempt to divert attention from his criminal presidency and fire up his radical base.\"Writing in the conservative news outlet The Daily Wire on Wednesday, Russell T. Vought, Mr. Trump's acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, called him \"the most pro-life president in history\" and celebrated what he called \"a golden chapter for our movement.\"PhotographPresident Trump, who once called himself \"very pro-choice,\" has until now addressed the March for Life only remotely.

Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom Mr. Trump was so eager to paint as corrupt that his attempts to do so led to his impeachment, pulled off one of the most remarkable political comebacks in recent history, winning nine states and joining Senator Bernie Sanders as a front-runner in the Democratic presidential race.U.S. stocks did make a comeback on Wednesday, closing nearly 1,200 points up, which counted as good news for a president betting the farm on a healthy economy. The bad news was the reason many analysts cited for the gains was Mr. Biden's Super Tuesday victories.For Mr. Trump, whose belief in his own ability to shape external events is a source of comfort, it has been a week of confronting the fact that almost nothing is in his control right now.He has dealt with the coronavirus, the first external crisis of his administration, by repeating a string of falsehoods rather than delivering reassurance. He has claimed, falsely, that a vaccine would be ready within months when in reality, it won't be ready for more than a year. And his insistence that his administration deserves an \"A+++\" for its response has done little to calm the rattled markets or an anxious electorate.There has long been a disconnect between the way Mr. Trump sees politics and the way his more seasoned advisers do. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has been focused on Mr. Sanders and his longtime rival Michael R. Bloomberg. But privately, several advisers said on Wednesday that they were not surprised that Democrats rallied around Mr. Biden, even if the president was.And they anticipated an ugly slog of a campaign going forward, with the brutal 2016 general election race against Hillary Clinton serving as a reminder of how Mr. Trump will try to tarnish his rivals, even as voters on Tuesday appeared to favor a candidate who projected calm stability over upheaval and uncertainty.Trump campaign officials said on Wednesday that they viewed Mr. Biden as \"Hillary Clinton Lite,\" a candidate who they will argue generated little enthusiasm of his own while coasting off the opposition to the president and Mr. Sanders among Democrats. They said they planned to undercut his support from black voters by highlighting Mr. Biden's vote for the now-controversial 1994 crime bill, while talking up Mr. Trump's work on criminal justice reform.And they said they would seek to elevate his backing of trade policies like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal that originated under President Barack Obama.But they face a daunting challenge. Mr. Obama remains deeply popular with Democratic voters, and highlighting Mr. Biden's work with him could simply energize his supporters to turn out for him in the fall if he is the nominee. And unlike Mrs. Clinton, who was viewed negatively by a large swath of voters over decades, Mr. Biden may have a stronger bond with some voters in his party.Mr. Trump's frustration over the election results was evident in one of his early-morning Twitter posts on Wednesday -- a screed against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was forced into a runoff for his old Senate seat in Alabama, and whom Mr. Trump still blames for the two-year inquiry into a possible conspiracy between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials.\"This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn't have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!\" Mr. Trump tweeted, after Mr. Sessions fell short of securing a majority in the Republican primary.In a moment of uncertainty, Mr. Trump appeared to be grasping at the equivalent of comfort food: attacking Mr. Sessions. It was, people close to the president said, his reward for staying quiet during Mr. Sessions's primary race, and also a way for the president to highlight a race in which his sustained attacks on Mr. Sessions before the campaign ultimately affected his ability to cleanly win.It was also clear that Mr. Trump's attempt to dictate the contours of the Democratic presidential contest has had little comparable effect.For months, Mr. Trump has told aides he believes he can shape the Democratic race to his own advantage by focusing on specific candidates. And he has been more overt than any incumbent in trying to influence the nominating contest of another party, training his Twitter feed on his potential rivals and trying to deepen authentic divisions in the Democratic Party by stoking fears that the establishment was trying to rob Mr. Sanders of the nomination.In January, he floated the idea that the Senate impeachment trial was intended to keep Mr. Sanders grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Iowa before the caucuses there.\"They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. That month, Trump aides also began to see Mr. Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and sought to elevate his profile.The president began singling out Mr. Sanders at his \"Keep America Great\" rallies as well as on Twitter. \"Bernie is going up,\" Mr. Trump said in January at a rally in Toledo, Ohio. \"He's surging. Crazy Bernie, he's surging.\" He has also highlighted the senator's surges in the polls.Another target was Mr. Bloomberg, who spent millions of dollars on ads attacking Mr. Trump and had no compunction contrasting his wealth with the president's.On Tuesday, as polls opened in 14 states, the president tried a directive to voters in Texas and Oklahoma. \"Mini Mike Bloomberg will kill your drilling, fracking and pipelines,\" he tweeted. \"Petroleum based 'anything' is dead. Energy jobs gone. Don't vote for Mini Mike!\"Mr. Bloomberg's withdrawal from the race on Wednesday may provide Mr. Trump with a small measure of comfort. But it also presents a looming challenge for his campaign, as Mr. Bloomberg has promised to spend $1 billion to help the Democratic nominee and immediately threw his support to Mr. Biden.Also a challenge is the surprise surge of a candidate with a genuine connection with African-American voters, the essential element to Mr. Biden's success on Super Tuesday.The Trump campaign has recently put money and time into trying to expand the president's popularity among black voters, employing tactics like opening storefronts in black neighborhoods and devoting a Super Bowl ad to overhauling the criminal justice system. Mr. Trump won only 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, but his campaign operatives thought that facing a candidate like Mr. Sanders, who had his own challenge winning over African-American voters, created an opportunity for Mr. Trump.But for months, Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and his work for Burisma, a problem-plagued energy company in Ukraine, have been the main concern of the president and his advisers. That effort was central to the impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump tried to pressure Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens in exchange for releasing military aid.The damage to the president was obvious, but the former vice president's candidacy also suffered. His poll standing fell as he struggled to answer questions from reporters and voters about his son.But the revival of Mr. Biden illustrates the limits of Mr. Trump's influence.\"I think Democratic primary voters are numbing to Trump's buffoonery -- black voters in particular,\" said Addisu Demissie, who managed Senator Cory Booker's presidential campaign. \"They are the ones who have breathed life back into Biden's campaign and, if anything, they may relish seeing Biden take him down.\"The only real role that Mr. Trump appeared to play on Tuesday was to ensure that electability was a chief concern for Democratic voters and was the basis for Mr. Biden's support.\"I would describe him as Sideshow Bob in this process,\" said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. \"There's no evidence that he's commanding a large army of voters who are affecting Democratic primaries.\"Despite his lack of influence, Mr. Trump appeared eager on Wednesday to continue his kibbitzing-from-the-sidelines role. \"No question on the election?\" he asked reporters in the Roosevelt Room, where he met with airline executives about the coronavirus.The president smiled as White House aides quickly shuffled reporters out of the room.PhotographPresident Trump outside the White House on Tuesday.

New gear in tow, they might then grab a bag of popcorn at the next table, or register to vote at the next, or perhaps take a selfie with the life-size cardboard cutout of the president standing nearby.Why had approximately 350 people decided to devote five hours of a Tuesday to this?\"We're tired of watching President Trump be beat up,\" Dawn Thorburn, 51, a retiree, explained. \"This impeachment thing going on is a big farce, and we just want to show support for him, because it's a joke what they're trying to do.\"There was a time when voters like Ms. Thorburn may well have rationalized staying home on a night like this, watching the address in their pajamas, unshackled by the event's one-popcorn-per-person rule. It was Mr. Trump himself who warned that winning might get tiring, that spoiling his supporters risked lulling them into a false sense of security ahead of the 2020 election.\"The Trump base -- they're working. They're busy. They don't want to have to keep fighting for the president,\" said Meshawn Maddock, a co-founder of Michigan Trump Republicans. \"We've all got a lot of other things we could be doing.\"But if the president's core supporters have shown signs of flatlining, his impeachment has jolted them alive again. Of the near-dozen people interviewed at the watch party, almost all said the impeachment inquiry and trial had motivated a spike in their own activism, whether it was knocking on doors or registering as a precinct captain.They seemed driven not so much by a desire to litigate the charges against Mr. Trump -- though, to be clear, they believe he did nothing wrong -- as by a mandate to protest the act of investigation altogether. Because in their view, Democrats, through impeachment, had committed the gravest of sins against the president: They'd disrespected him.\"It fires people up. It gets them mad,\" Ms. Maddock said. \"I mean, it's exactly what the Trump base needed.\"Julia Nichols, 52, who works in the automotive industry, was among the fired-up and mad. Wearing a baby-pink MAGA hat and gold hoop earrings, reclining slightly in the theater's plush chairs, she welcomed the feeling.\"What the Democrats have shown me is that they cannot be trusted. So that's why I've become more of an activist, why I've gotten more active with the current campaign,\" she said of impeachment. \"I'm not going to take this crap sitting down.\"Ms. Nichols said she's long believed the greatest threat to President Trump's re-election was not the incumbent himself -- what he's done, what he hasn't -- but rather his own supporters.\"People can easily become complacent,\" she said. \"Because right now the economy is booming, people are doing good. And they may not feel that urgency to get out there.\"\"That's the greatest vulnerability,\" she went on, \"us not communicating to our family, friends, and neighbors what's at stake in this election.\"As the president delivered his address, his visage casting the theater in a soft orange glow, the crowd made sure to vocalize their sense of the stakes. Whenever a Democrat appeared onscreen, the crowd erupted in boos, along with a stray \"Send them back!\" for Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.They saved their loudest jeers for Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- laughing as the president appeared to ignore her outstretched hand before the speech, booing as she ripped up her copy after it was over.As Mr. Trump condemned Venezuela strongman Nicolas Maduro as \"a tyrant who brutalizes,\" and Ms. Pelosi initially appeared expressionless, one man scoffed. \"She loves him!\" he shouted. \"She's his pen pal!\" And when Ms. Pelosi recoiled at Mr. Trump's claim that her party supports free health care for undocumented immigrants, twice mouthing \"not true,\" the same man laughed. \"Oh, Pelosi,\" he said. \"Stew, baby -- stew!\"Mr. Trump and his administration, on the other hand, earned deafening cheers. As the president and his cabinet entered the lower chamber, the crowd reacted as if hyping an NBA team's starting lineup. \"BARR!\" one man shouted when the cameras panned to William P. Barr, the attorney general. Even the briefest shot of Melania Trump, the first lady, seated in the balcony in head-to-toe black, sparked joy. \"So beautiful,\" much of the audience could be heard whispering.Not once in his speech did the president mention the Senate impeachment trial, or the vote set for Wednesday afternoon.Hours before the address, Ms. Maddock said she was eager to see how Mr. Trump would handle the topic. \"They're talking about how the president, he's not even going to say the word 'impeach' in the speech,\" she said of fellow Trump supporters.Ms. Maddock wasn't so sure. \"He's going to look out into that room,\" she predicted, \"and he's going to see all the Democrats not standing, he's going to look at the senators voting against him, or who've threatened to, and he's going to go after them.\"Instead, Mr. Trump did not mention impeachment once, leaving it to his supporters -- the ones who've been reinvigorated by the \"sham\" of it all, as one woman in Novi put it -- to carry the torch.Ultimately, many of those at the watch party seemed to prefer it that way. Throughout the night, voters spoke of Mr. Trump in a distinctly protective manner. They did so with pride, too -- as if the task of defending the president, batting back his naysayers, was uniquely theirs, a solemn charge handed down from the man himself.\"We don't go out there screaming and crying and yelling, but we are going to go out there and make sure that President Trump is treated with respect,\" Ms. Thorburn said. \"That's what we want to protect -- his position as president.\"\"However,\" she added, \"I do think President Trump can protect himself.\"Ms. Nichols quickly interjected. \"But,\" she argued, \"we do need to have his back.\"Ms. Thorburn nodded. \"That's right,\" she said. \"We do need to have it.\"Until that point, Sandra Wood, 60, who volunteers for Republican campaigns in Michigan, had hardly spoken. But she wanted to quibble with her new friend's earlier point -- that the president's supporters didn't need to scream or cry or yell to get their message across.Before impeachment, Ms. Wood said, she might have agreed. But Democrats had finally overplayed their hand -- Mr. Trump's likely acquittal be damned. From now until November, \"we are going to scream,\" she pledged. \"We have to.\"PhotographRepublicans gathered in a movie theater Tuesday in Novi, Mich., to watch the State of the Union.

Roberts Jr. presiding from the marble rostrum and senators sworn to silence looking on from desks piled with briefing books. It was the substantive start of the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.Tensions grew so raw after midnight that Chief Justice Roberts cut in just before 1 a.m. to admonish the managers and the president's lawyers to \"remember where they are\" and return to \"civil discourse.\"\"They are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body,\" he said.On its face, the prolonged debate was about the rules and procedures. But it set the stage for a broader political fight over Mr. Trump's likely acquittal and will help shape the 2020 campaign.Democrats were laying the groundwork to argue that the trial was rigged on Mr. Trump's behalf and to denounce Republicans -- including the most vulnerable senators seeking re-election -- for acquiescing. Republicans, for their part, insisted that the Senate must move decisively to remedy what they characterized as an illegitimate impeachment inquiry unjustly tarring the presidency.Standing in the well of the Senate, the Democratic House impeachment managers urged senators to reject proposed rules from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, that would delay a debate over witnesses and documents until the middle of the trial, with no guarantee that they would ever be called.\"If the Senate votes to deprive itself of witnesses and documents, the opening statements will be the end of the trial,\" said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead manager. He said Mr. McConnell's proposal was tantamount to saying, \"Let's have the trial, and maybe we can just sweep this all under the rug.\"But Republicans were unpersuaded and, just before 2 a.m. Eastern, voted along party lines, 53 to 47, to ratify Mr. McConnell's trial plan. As adopted, the resolution would pave the way for oral arguments against Mr. Trump to begin as soon as Wednesday.They rejected 10 other amendments by the same margin. An 11th Democratic proposal, to lengthen the timetable for the prosectors and defense to file trial motions, gained the support of one Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, but still failed.At the heart of the trial are charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress approved last month by the Democratic-led House. They assert that Mr. Trump used the power of his office to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals, withholding as leverage nearly $400 million in military aid and a White House meeting. The president then sought to conceal his actions from Congress, the charges say, by blocking witness testimony and documents.Mr. Trump's legal team argues that the charges are baseless and amount to criminalizing a president's prerogative to make foreign policy as he sees fit. In a break with most constitutional scholars, they also claim that the impeachment was unconstitutional because the articles of impeachment do not outline a specific violation of a law.But on Tuesday, the debate focused principally on what would constitute a fair trial.\"This initial step will offer an early signal to our country,\" Mr. McConnell said before it got underway. \"Can the Senate still serve our founding purpose?\"Mr. McConnell also received a sharp reminder about the limits of his power to control an inherently unpredictable proceeding.Under pressure from Republican moderates, he was forced early in the day to make some last-minute changes to the set of rules he unveiled on Monday, which would have squeezed opening arguments by both sides into two 12-hour marathon days. Mr. McConnell's rules also would have refused to admit the findings of the House impeachment inquiry into evidence without a separate vote later in the trial.The compressed timetable was in line with a White House request to quickly dispense with opening arguments so that Mr. Trump's team could complete his defense before the weekend.But Ms. Collins, Rob Portman of Ohio and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, among others, objected privately to those provisions, which they believed departed too much from procedures adopted unanimously for the 1999 trial of President Bill Clinton and could further expose Republicans to accusations of unfairness.The objections were raised at a closed-door luncheon just before the trial was to begin, according to aides familiar with the conversation. Mr. McConnell rushed to submit a revised copy of the resolution -- with lines crossed out and changes scrawled in pen in the margins -- when it was time for the debate.When the resolution was read aloud on the Senate floor, two days had been extended to three and the House's records would be automatically admitted into evidence, though Mr. McConnell inserted a new provision that would allow Mr. Trump's team to move to throw out parts of the House case.The last-minute reversal underscored the influence of a small group of moderate Republicans in the narrowly divided Senate whose interests and demands could prove decisive in a more formal debate over witnesses and documents to come.Half a world away, Mr. Trump sought to use the global stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to project confidence about his standing at home. He swatted away questions from reporters about the trial, instead bragging about the strength of the American economy under his leadership.But in the Senate chamber, Mr. Trump's lawyers replayed many of his most frequent and personal grievances, accusing Democrats in only slightly more lawyerly terms of conducting a political search-and-destroy mission.\"It's long past time that we start this so we can put an end to this ridiculous charade and go have an election,\" said Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel.The historically rare debate was rendered even more unusual by the traditional Senate rules that prohibit senators from speaking on the chamber floor for the duration of the proceedings and instead empower the House managers and White House defense lawyers to debate the proposals. The effect was that on the trial's first day, the Senate chamber split cleanly into partisan factions, with the managers siding with Senate Democrats and Mr. Trump's lawyers taking the place of the Republicans.Mr. Cipollone rose first, delivering a brief statement urging senators to support Mr. McConnell's proposed rules and accusing Democrats of seeking to use the Senate to complete their sloppy investigative work.\"We believe that once you hear those initial presentations, the only conclusion will be that the president has done nothing wrong,\" Mr. Cipollone said, \"and that these articles of impeachment do not begin to approach the standard required by the Constitution.\"Democrats, who came armed with slick digital slides and video clips to drive home their arguments, spent hours detailing the factual record compiled by the House investigation and cataloging the witnesses and thousands of pages of highly relevant documents Mr. Trump had succeeded in withholding. Senators facing such a grave decision as removing a president, they argued, have a responsibility to try to push all the facts to light.\"With the backing of a subpoena authorized by the chief justice of the United States, you can end President Trump's obstruction,\" said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the first woman in history to speak on the Senate floor as an impeachment manager. \"If the Senate fails to take this step, you won't even ask for the evidence. This trial and your verdict will be questioned.\"Just an hour or so before the trial began, the seven House managers submitted one final written rebuttal to arguments put forward against their charges by Mr. Trump's lawyers. In 34 pages, they rejected the lawyers' assertion that abuse of power was not an impeachable offense and that Mr. Trump had acted legally when he ordered administration officials not to appear for questioning in the House or provide documents for the impeachment inquiry.Locked in silence for much of the day, senators were able to talk only before the proceeding began or during brief breaks. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday morning, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, denounced Mr. McConnell's rules as deeply unfair and skewed toward Mr. Trump.\"It is completely partisan. It was kept secret until the eve of the trial,\" he said. \"The McConnell rules seem to have been designed by President Trump and for President Trump, simply executed by Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans.\"Inside the chamber, Mr. Schumer forced votes on demanding documents and compelling testimony from four current and former Trump administration officials who were blocked from speaking with the House: John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Robert B. Blair, an adviser to Mr. Mulvaney; and Michael Duffey, a White House budget official.Each time, Mr. McConnell moved to kill the proposal before it could be considered, and was sustained by unified Republican support. At one point, he offered to short-circuit the debate to speed up the votes, but Democrats who want a full account of Mr. Trump's blockade on record declined.\"This is the fair road map for our trial,\" Mr. McConnell declared. \"We need it in place before we can move forward.\"Even after Tuesday's changes, Mr. McConnell's proposal makes way for potentially the fastest presidential impeachment trial in American history, particularly if the Senate declines to call witnesses.Only two other American presidents have stood trial in the Senate for high crimes and misdemeanors. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868, and his trial took the better part of three months, featuring testimony from dozens of witnesses and extended periods for discovery, before he was ultimately acquitted by just a single vote. Mr. Clinton's trial lasted five weeks, included testimony from just three witnesses and resulted in an overwhelming acquittal.Without witnesses, Mr. Trump's trial could conclude by the end of January. If senators ultimately do call witnesses, that timeline could stretch weeks longer.Catie Edmondson and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographRepresentative Adam Schiff, the Democrats' lead impeachment manager, spoke in the Senate as the trial of President Trump began.

In the state he represents, though, many view speaking out against President Trump as an act to admire, not an apostasy.SALT LAKE CITY -- Phil Lyman wanted to do something swift and stern.Within hours of Senator Mitt Romney's vote to remove President Trump from office on Wednesday, Mr. Lyman, a freshman state representative from southern Utah who keeps an autographed \"Make America Great Again\" hat in a plexiglass case in his office, was at work drafting a resolution to censure the senator.\"I mean, I respect a guy that will stand up for his opinion, but it's not without some repercussions,\" Mr. Lyman said. \"His action warrants an additional action on the part of the State Legislature.\"But just as swiftly came the pushback to Mr. Lyman from Utah's Republican leadership.\"Censuring Senator Romney for voting his conscience is a tricky place to be,\" the speaker of the state House, Brad Wilson, said in an interview.The governor, Gary Herbert, told The Salt Lake Tribune, \"I think that would be just a mistake to go down that road.\"The president of the State Senate, J. Stuart Adams, pleaded for reconciliation. \"What I don't want to do is move into the negative rhetoric I think is coming from Washington, D.C.,\" he said at a news conference on Friday.Barely eight years ago, Mr. Romney was the Republican nominee for president and putative leader of the party. Today, the way many Republicans accept and even encourage the attacks on him from Mr. Trump, who last week accused him of using \"religion as a crutch\" to justify the impeachment vote, vividly illustrates the turn the party has taken.Utah Republicans never quite fell for Mr. Trump as hard as the rest of their party did. The state's political sensibilities, heavily influenced by its Mormon culture, are more agree-to-disagree than salt-the-earth. The president's coarse language, belittling nicknames and aversion to humility help explain why his approval ratings over all in Utah have been below 50 percent for most of the last three years.And while they support Mr. Trump as their president -- very few Republicans here say they would have voted to convict him as Mr. Romney did -- they have refused to join the pile-on they see happening back east on Fox News sets and in social media feeds of the president's followers, where their junior senator is being vilified as a \"coward\" and \"Judas\" who should be expelled from the Republican Party.Not only does Mr. Lyman's censure resolution appear to be dead on arrival, but the leader of the State Senate, Mr. Adams, also said last week that he would rather not vote on or debate any action related to Mr. Romney at all. He stressed that anything his chamber took up should be \"positive\" -- a word he used repeatedly as he spoke to reporters at the State Capitol on Friday. He said he preferred something like a unanimously agreed-to statement that affirmed Mr. Trump's strengths as president.\"It may feel right -- you want to swing at someone -- but I think it's better off to do what's right,\" Mr. Adams said in an interview. Though he disagreed with how Mr. Romney voted, he added, \"I have respect for what he did.\"Utah is one of the rare places where the few Romney-style Republicans who remain are relatively safe from a challenge from their right, where speaking out against the president can be an act to admire, not an apostasy.With the most vitriolic condemnation of Mr. Romney coming from outside Utah, there has been something of a rallying effect around the senator.\"Not everyone hates Romney,\" read the headline on an opinion article in The Tribune this weekend. \"In spite of the loud voices who are busy calling him names, there are many of us out here who are cheering for him,\" wrote the author, Holly Richardson, a former Republican legislator.Salt Lake City's other major paper, The Deseret News, which is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, published an editorial arguing against a censure of the senator and has run numerous other supportive pieces, including one declaring that his vote was \"what a Christian conscience demands.\"Chris Karpowitz, a professor of political science at Brigham Young University, said the disputes between Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump illustrated two different visions about what it means to be a Republican.\"Sometimes they line up on policy,\" Dr. Karpowitz added. \"But in terms of style and rhetoric and commitment to what in previous years were thought of as core values, they couldn't be more different.\"No state as heavily Republican has been so chilly to the president. Though active registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in Utah by more than three to one, Mr. Trump won only 45 percent of the vote in Utah in 2016. Hillary Clinton and Evan McMullin, a former intelligence officer who ran as a third-party candidate, split up the rest of the vote.Last week, national conservative activists promoted a \"Recall Romney\" effort online and shared stories about a proposal circulating in the legislature that aimed to give voters the ability to recall their United States senators.Aimee Winder Newton, a Republican candidate for governor, said that such a move would have worrisome repercussions. \"I get that many state legislators are disappointed,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"But creating a culture of censuring could come back their way.\"In reality, the recall bill was drafted months ago and has little support in Salt Lake City. Its sponsor has said that it has nothing to do with Mr. Romney or impeachment, and is instead meant to bolster the rights of Utahans to hold all senators accountable.Lawmakers and constitutional experts said the measure would probably not survive a court challenge anyway.\"My strong impression,\" said Edward Foley, the director of election law at Ohio State University, \"is that this kind of recall would be clearly unconstitutional. After all, the Constitution itself specifies six-year terms for senators, and has no mechanism -- other than expulsion by the Senate itself -- for a state to end a U.S. senator's service before the six years are up.\"Mr. Romney is by no means infallible among Utahans. And Mr. Trump is more popular here now than he was four years ago, thanks to a strong economy and his dedication to filling the courts with conservative judges.Though Mr. Romney is often associated with Utah because of his role in leading Salt Lake City's effort to prepare for the 2002 Winter Olympics, he had spent most of his life living elsewhere before deciding to run for Senate in 2018 -- a liability in a state where many families can trace their lineage back to the mid-19th century, when Mormons arrived in the Salt Lake Valley. His campaign ran into trouble early on with activist Republicans when he lost to a little-known legislator at the state convention, which forced a primary he later won. In the general election he won with almost 63 percent of the vote statewide.But the objections of grass-roots conservatives who have outsize influence in state conventions had little to do with Mr. Romney's history of feuding with Mr. Trump. Instead, they bristled at an attempt by Mr. Romney to gather enough signatures to circumvent the convention.Mr. Romney has worked diligently to cultivate relationships with Republicans in Salt Lake City. After he left Washington the day of his vote on the president, one of his first stops was at the State Capitol to meet Republican lawmakers to explain himself. He spoke at two different meetings, one with House members and another with the Senate leadership.He delivered a version of the speech he gave on the Senate floor last Wednesday in which he said his oath to God and faith guided him toward \"the most difficult decision I have ever faced.\" Some legislators questioned his motives, asking why they should believe that he wasn't just trying to get even with the president. Others worried about Utah suddenly finding itself in the president's cross hairs and whether it would damage its relationship with the federal government, which controls about two-thirds of the state's land.\"For a lot of us,\" said Speaker Wilson, \"the question was: 'What does this decision mean for your effectiveness as our senator?\"'The meeting was intended primarily for legislative leaders, but Mr. Lyman, the author of the censure resolution, was invited as well. In an interview, he said that Mr. Romney had earned his respect for showing up, but not for his vote.He had only a few seconds to address Mr. Romney as the senator was leaving and used the opportunity to defend Mr. Trump for reducing the size of protected federal land in Utah so it could be used for commercial purposes.\"There's a lot of talk in politics,\" Mr. Lyman recalled telling the senator. \"And President Trump actually came out here and did something.\"But even Mr. Lyman's disappointment with Mr. Romney has its limits. Next to the bookcase in his office at the Capitol where he has his autographed MAGA hat stands another political memento he is proud of: a life-size cutout of Mr. Romney.PhotographSome in the Utah G.O.P. said that Senator Mitt Romney voted to remove President Trump out of conscience.

China has committed to buying an additional $200 billion worth of American goods and services by 2021 and is expected to ease some of the tariffs it has placed on American products.But the agreement preserves the bulk of the tariffs that Mr. Trump has placed on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, and it maintains the threat of additional punishment if Beijing does not live up to the terms of the deal.\"Today we take a momentous step, one that has never been taken before with China toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade with China,\" Mr. Trump said at a ceremony at the White House. \"Together we are righting the wrongs of the past.\"The deal caps more than two years of tense negotiations and escalating threats that at times seemed destined to plunge the United States and China into a permanent economic war. Mr. Trump, who campaigned for president in 2016 on a promise to get tough on China, pushed his negotiators to rewrite trade terms that he said had destroyed American industry and jobs, and he imposed record tariffs on Chinese goods in a gamble to get Beijing to accede to his demands.\"As a candidate for president, I vowed strong action,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Unlike those who came before me, I kept my promise.\"The agreement is a significant turning point in American trade policy and the types of free-trade agreements that the United States has typically supported. Rather than lowering tariffs to allow for the flow of goods and services to meet market demand, this deal leaves a record level of tariffs in place and forces China to buy $200 billion worth of specific products within two years.To Mr. Trump and other supporters, the approach corrects for past trade deals that enabled corporate outsourcing and led to lost jobs and industries. To critics, it is the type of managed trade approach that the United States has long criticized, especially with regard to China and its control over its economy.While other presidents have tried to change China's economic approach, Mr. Trump has leaned into it. The agreement stipulates that \"China shall ensure\" that its purchases meet the $200 billion figure by 2021, all but guaranteeing an export boom as Mr. Trump heads into the 2020 election.\"Although the administration claims it wants to enhance market forces in China, the purchase commitments hailed by the president will only strengthen the role of the state in the economy,\" said Daniel Price, a former George W. Bush administration official and the managing director of Rock Creek Global Advisors.The president's approach may pay off politically. He will head into a re-election campaign with a commitment from China to strengthen its intellectual-property protections, make large purchases of American products and pursue other economic changes that will benefit American business.China's leader, Xi Jinping, said in a message conveyed to Mr. Trump that the deal is \"beneficial to both China, the U.S. -- and the world.\" Mr. Xi also said the agreement showed that the two countries, \"based on equality and mutual respect, through dialogue and consultations,\" can find proper and effective solutions to problems.At a lavish White House ceremony crowded with cabinet members, lawmakers and executives from America's biggest companies, Mr. Trump seized on the signing as a counterweight to impeachment proceedings that were taking place across town, where lawmakers were about to vote to approve House prosecutors for a Senate trial.\"They have a hoax going on over there -- let's take care of it,\" he said.But the agreement has plenty of critics in both parties, who say that Mr. Trump's tactics have been economically damaging and that the deal leaves many important economic issues unresolved.Those include cybersecurity and China's tight controls over how companies handle data and cloud computing. China rejected demands that the text include promises to refrain from hacking American companies, insisting it was not a trade issue.And the deal does little to resolve more pernicious structural issues surrounding China's approach, particularly its pattern of subsidizing and supporting crucial industries that compete with American companies, like solar energy and steel. American businesses blame those economic practices for allowing cheap Chinese goods to flood the United States.\"A ceremony at the White House can't hide the stark truth about the 'Phase 1' China trade deal: The deal does absolutely nothing to curtail China's subsidies to its manufacturers,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which includes manufacturers and the United Steelworkers union, said in a tweet. \"All those 'forgotten men and women' in U.S. factories have, once again, been forgotten.\"The administration has said it will address some of these changes in Phase 2 of the negotiations and is keeping tariffs in place in part to maintain leverage for the next round of talks. Mr. Trump said he would remove all tariffs if the two sides reach agreement on the next phase.\"I will agree to take those tariffs off if we're able to do Phase 2,\" he said.But Mr. Trump has already kicked the deadline for another agreement past the November election, and there is deep skepticism that the two countries will reach another deal anytime soon.As part of the deal, Mr. Trump agreed to reduce the rate on tariffs imposed in September and forgo additional import taxes in the future. But the United States will continue to maintain tariffs covering 65 percent of American imports from China, according to tracking by Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. That leaves the United States with an overall tariff rate higher than that of any other advanced nation, as well as China, India and Turkey.China will still tax 57 percent of imports from the United States in retaliation, according to Mr. Bown, though it's possible some of those levies may be waived in the weeks to come.The two sides did not immediately distribute copies of the agreement in Chinese, raising the question of whether translation issues had been fully resolved and whether the final text would be as demanding of the Beijing government in the Chinese version as in the English version.\"We also need to be sure that the wording of the agreement is the same in both the Chinese and English versions -- history has shown that mismatches become easily exploited loopholes,\" said Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.While updates about the trade war transfixed investors for much of the last two years, the official signing of the deal was greeted with something of a shrug. The S&P 500 rose roughly 0.2 percent. A gauge of semiconductor companies, which have been particularly sensitive to the trade war, fell more than 1 percent.The deal came under fire from top Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who criticized the agreement for failing to address China's state-owned enterprises and industrial subsidies. He suggested that President Xi was privately laughing at the United States and that China has \"taken President Trump to the cleaners.\"\"This Phase 1 deal is an extreme disappointment to me and to millions and millions of Americans who want to see us make China play fair,\" Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor.Wendy Cutler, a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute who negotiated trade pacts for the Obama administration, called the gains \"meaningful, but modest.\"\"Because the United States was willing to compromise with China and not press them on the most difficult issues, they were able to reach positive ground,\" she said.The trade deal contains a variety of victories for American industry, including opening up markets for biotechnology, beef and poultry. Banks, insurers, drug companies and the energy industry are also big beneficiaries.China has also agreed not to force American companies to hand over their technology as a condition of doing business there, under penalty of further tariffs. And it will refrain from directing its companies to obtain sensitive foreign technology through acquisitions. The agreement also includes a pledge by both countries not to devalue their currencies to gain an advantage in export markets.The president trumpeted many of China's concessions during the signing ceremony, singling out audience members who will benefit. He called out a litany of Wall Street executives, many of whom have been pressing for greater access to China's financial services market, including Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity firm the Blackstone Group, and Kenneth C. Griffin, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Citadel. He also mentioned the chiefs of Boeing, Citibank, Visa and the American International Group, and the chip makers Micron and Qualcomm.Referring to the energy purchases in the agreement, Mr. Trump told Senator Joni Ernst, the Iowa Republican, who was in attendance: \"You got ethanol, so you can't be complaining.\"But those victories have come at a heavy price. The uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's tariff threats and approach to trade has weighed on the economy, raising prices for businesses and consumers, delaying corporate investments and slowing growth around the globe. Businesses with exposure to China, like Deere & Company and Caterpillar, have laid off some workers and lowered revenue expectations, in part citing the trade war.And other sources of tension remain in the United States-China relationship. The Trump administration has taken a tougher approach to scrutinizing Chinese investments and technology purchases for national security threats, including blacklisting Chinese companies like Huawei, the telecom firm.\"I think it's maybe a useful pause in the downward spiral of U.S.-China relations,\" Susan Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, said of the trade deal.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from BeijingPhotographPresident Trump, left, had lunch with China's trade delegation and others after signing the trade accord, in which China agreed to buy more American farm goods.

With Mr. Trump's acquittal virtually certain, the president's allies rallied to his defense, though some conceded he was guilty of the central allegations against him.The Democrats' push for more witnesses and documents failed 49 to 51, with only two Republicans, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, joining Democrats in favor. A vote on the verdict is planned for Wednesday.As they approached the final stage of the third presidential impeachment proceeding in United States history, Democrats condemned the witness vote and said it would render Mr. Trump's trial illegitimate and his acquittal meaningless.\"America will remember this day, unfortunately, where the Senate did not live up to its responsibilities, when the Senate turned away from truth and went along with a sham trial,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \"If the president is acquitted, with no witnesses, no documents, the acquittal will have no value because Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial.\"Even as they prepared to vote against removing him, several Republicans challenged Mr. Trump's repeated assertions that he had done nothing wrong, saying they believed he had committed the main offense of which he was accused: withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.Still, those Republicans said, they were unwilling to remove a president fewer than 10 months before he is to face voters.\"If you are persuaded that he did it, why do you need more witnesses?\" said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, a critical swing vote on the issue whose late decision to oppose considering new evidence all but sealed Mr. Trump's swift acquittal. \"The country is not going to accept being told that they can't elect the president they want to elect in the week the election starts by a majority for a merely inappropriate telephone call or action.\"\"You don't apply capital punishment for every offense,\" Mr. Alexander added.The vote signaled the end of a saga that has consumed Washington and threatened Mr. Trump's hold on the presidency for the past five months, since the emergence in September of an anonymous whistle-blower complaint accusing him of using the levers of government to push Ukraine to interfere on his behalf in the 2020 election.Senators recessed the trial for the weekend and will return Monday for closing arguments, with a vote on the verdict on Wednesday.The timetable will rob Mr. Trump of the opportunity to use his State of the Union address scheduled for Tuesday night to boast about his acquittal, a prospect he has relished for several weeks. Instead, he will become the second president to deliver the speech during his own impeachment trial.The senators adopted the plan by a partisan vote on Friday night, but only after Democrats tried once last time to subpoena four administration officials, including the former national security adviser John R. Bolton, and a collection of documents relevant to the case.At the White House, Mr. Trump raged against a process he has dismissed from the start as a \"witch hunt\" and a \"hoax,\" preparing to make Democratic attempts to remove him a centerpiece of his re-election campaign.\"No matter what you give to the Democrats, in the end, they will NEVER be satisfied,\" the president wrote on Twitter. \"In the House, they gave us NOTHING!\"The outcome of the final vote was not in doubt. It would take a two-thirds majority -- 67 senators -- to convict Mr. Trump and remove him from office.The president has insisted that he did nothing wrong, calling a July telephone conversation in which he asked the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals \"perfect\" and the impeachment inquiry a \"sham.\" For months, he has demanded that his allies deliver nothing less than an absolute defense of his actions. But while they were poised to acquit him, several Republicans offered words of criticism, instead.Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said that \"some of the president's actions in this case -- including asking a foreign country to investigate a potential political opponent and the delay of aid to Ukraine -- were wrong and inappropriate.\"Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, suggested that he did not necessarily consider the president innocent, either.\"Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a president from office,\" he said. \"I will not vote to remove the president because doing so would inflict extraordinary and potentially irreparable damage to our already divided nation.\"Not every Republican senator thought Mr. Trump acted improperly. \"For three-plus years, Democrats have been trying to parse every one of his words, add their traditional view and find themselves often perplexed,\" said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota. \"Part of the problem is that most of America likes the straight talk and occasionally forgives if he doesn't say exactly the right thing.\"Reflecting the depth of the country's divisions, both sides were already looking past the trial to begin framing the fight over Mr. Trump's conduct ahead of the November election. The first voting of the season is Monday in Iowa.With the threat of conviction removed, Mr. Trump enters the election season as the first impeached president in modern history to face voters. But his expected acquittal is also likely to leave the president emboldened. He will argue that Democrats, unelected bureaucrats and the mainstream news media have targeted him because of their disdain for his supporters, and that his fight for political survival is theirs as well.Democrats, too, planned to capitalize on the impeachment fight by urging voters to punish Republicans for refusing to demand a more thorough trial and for sticking with Mr. Trump despite evidence of his misdeeds. But they faced the risks of a potential backlash.After resisting impeachment for months, Speaker Nancy Pelosi embraced it amid revelations of Mr. Trump's actions toward Ukraine last fall. In doing so, she calculated that her party could not fail to act against a president whose actions it saw as clearly outrageous. But she confronted what she knew to be an unmovable reality in the Senate, where Democrats were certain to fall far short of removing him.Senate Republicans made a wager of their own that it was better to withstand the short-term criticisms rather than to allow the proceeding to stretch on and risking damaging revelations. In doing so, they are strapping their political fate to that of a polarizing president who enjoys unparalleled loyalty among conservative voters.The Republican victory was sealed on Friday just moments after the debate was gaveled open and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, issued a statement saying that a vote for additional witnesses would only extend what she called a \"partisan\" impeachment. Still, she lamented that the Senate trial had not been fair and that Congress had failed its obligation to the country.Ms. Murkowski did not indicate how she would vote on the final articles of impeachment, which she denounced as \"rushed and flawed.\" But she offered an unusually sharp rebuke of the institution in which she serves, appearing to cast blame on both parties and both chambers of Congress for letting excessive partisanship overtake a solemn responsibility.\"Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,\" she said. \"I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything.\"\"It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed,\" Ms. Murkowski addedSpeaking from the well of the Senate before the vote, the Democratic House managers made a final, urgent appeal for additional witnesses during a two-hour presentation on Friday. They warned senators that a refusal to hear new evidence would ensure that Mr. Trump would never be held accountable and would undermine the nation's democratic order and the public's faith in the institutions of government.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead House manager, seized on a New York Times report published in the hours before the vote to hammer home his point. The article revealed that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Bolton last May to assist in his pressure campaign on Ukraine.\"The facts will come -- out in all of their horror, they will come out,\" Mr. Schiff said. \"The witnesses the president is concealing will tell their stories,\" he added. \"And we will be asked why we didn't want to hear that information when we had the chance. What answer shall we give if we do not pursue the truth now?\"Mr. Trump's defense team vigorously argued the opposite view, telling senators they had all the evidence they needed to dismiss the charges before them, and warning that calling new witnesses would set a dangerous precedent by validating a rushed and incomplete case presented by the House.\"The Senate is not here to do the investigatory work that the House didn't do,\" said Patrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel.Reporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Catie Edmondson, Emily Cochrane and Patricia Mazzei.Reporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Catie Edmondson, Emily Cochrane and Patricia Mazzei.PhotographSenator Lisa Murkowski, top, Republican of Alaska, said calling witnesses would only extend a partisan impeachment.

But when Mr. Trump announced this week on Twitter that he planned to speak in front of the group, he made it clear he was intent on solidifying his support with socially conservative voters on the day House Democrats were making their final formal argument for his removal from office.In his remarks, which he delivered on a gray day from behind a plate of bulletproof glass, Mr. Trump spoke about what was at stake in the next election.\"The far left is actively working to erase our God-given rights,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that they wanted to \"silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life.\"The president accused Democrats of supporting infanticide, singling out Gov. Ralph S. Northam of Virginia for supporting a late-term abortion bill that Mr. Trump falsely said would \"execute a baby after birth.\" In his chilling accusation, the president was reiterating a messaging strategy that conservative activists have been using to rally his base to the polls in November.As if to emphasize his message on Friday, the Trump administration announced plans to withhold federal money from California if it did not drop a requirement that private insurers cover abortions. It gave the state 30 days to commit to lifting the requirement.But at the march, it was Mr. Trump's mere presence, more than any of his promises or his ominous warnings, that was cause for excitement.Roy Hagemyer, 62, a pastor from Mohave Valley, Ariz., who was standing at the corner of 15th Street and Constitution Avenue and handing out signs reading, \"Human Rights Begin in the Womb,\" could barely contain his excitement before Mr. Trump's speech.\"The president is going to speak here today, the first time in history,\" he said, smiling. \"That really puts a lot of horsepower behind our movement.\"Mr. Hagemyer said Mr. Trump's support makes him even more optimistic about the future. \"I firmly believe that in my lifetime we will see Roe v. Wade overturned,\" he said referring to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that extended federal protections to abortion. \"The tide is turning. People are starting to realize abortion is not something we should be doing.\"But Alexis McGill Johnson, the acting president and chief executive of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, pushed back on that idea in a statement after Mr. Trump's appearance.\"While Trump stands with the small number of Americans who want politicians to interfere with their personal health decisions, we'll be standing with the nearly 80 percent of Americans who support abortion access,\" Ms. Johnson said. \"We will never stop fighting for all of the people in this country who need access to sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion.\"Mr. Trump's relationship with the anti-abortion movement has been a transactional one since he entered politics in the 2016 presidential campaign. He has focused his efforts in particular on white evangelicals and Catholics, a critical part of his base in that campaign who could be even more important this November.In exchange for the appointment of anti-abortion judges, his unwavering support for Israel and his attempts to protect the rights of students to pray in schools, they have generally overlooked Mr. Trump's own complicated past with the issue and his own history of three marriages and two divorces.In an interview in 1999 on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Mr. Trump described himself as \"pro-choice in every respect,\" but he officially reversed positions in 2011, when he was considering running against President Barack Obama, and told the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, \"I'm pro-life.\" It was a move encouraged by his advisers at the time to get the issue out of the way early.It was not quite that easy. Four years ago this month, leading abortion opponents including Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony List, wrote a letter urging Iowans \"to support anyone but Trump\" in the Republican caucus because \"on the issue of defending unborn children and protecting women from the violence of abortion, Mr. Trump cannot be trusted.\"That changed once he won the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Ms. Dannenfelser led Mr. Trump's Pro-Life Coalition, and Mr. Trump wrote to anti-abortion leaders and publicly committed to pursuing their core policy objectives, and they worked to elect him. And evangelical misgivings about Mr. Trump, widely voiced during the campaign, have largely disappeared as a result of his efforts as president.More than 80 percent of white evangelical voters supported him in 2016, but a critical editorial last month in Christianity Today, a flagship evangelical magazine, raised concerns in the White House about the depth of Mr. Trump's support.But the president now routinely talks about mothers \"executing babies\" and brands Democrats the \"party of late-term abortion.\" And the political movement to end legalized abortion has become even more interwoven into the core strategy of Republican efforts to re-elect Mr. Trump by motivating white evangelical and Catholic voters.\"The difference between 2016 and now is how fully the Republican Party has accepted the issue as a driving force at the center of elections,\" Ms. Dannenfelser said in a phone interview.\"This president is the reason why,\" she said. \"He took it on, put it at the center of his campaign-fulfilled promises and is putting this cause at the center of his re-election this year.\"Aides like Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor were quick to promote him this week as the \"most pro-life president in history,\" while hours before Mr. Trump took the stage in Washington, Vice President Mike Pence discussed the March for Life with Pope Francis during a trip to the Vatican.For the anti-abortion movement, Mr. Trump's appearance at the March for Life is its most significant moment since it began in 1974, the year after the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide. His presence signified just how mainstream he has made their cause, which for years lacked power and resources compared with Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups.For many at the march, the president's presence symbolized a victory after years of complaints that their views were dismissed by the mainstream news media.\"He understands that physical presence communicates commitment and attachment,\" Ms. Dannenfelser said. \"Phoning it in is just what it sounds like -- it was a signal that the life movement was to be kept at arms distance. But no more.\"And for many in the crowd, seeing Mr. Trump and hearing his anti-abortion priorities far outweighed the impeachment trial happening in the Senate chamber at the other end of the mall.Karen Rains, 42, a dental hygienist from Henderson, Texas, stood with her daughter, 19, and mother, 72, waiting to see the president. People in her small town, she said, were not paying attention to impeachment at all.\"It's a waste of time; people are laughing at it,\" she said, holding a pink \"Women for Trump\" flag.\"I can't believe we are getting to do this,\" she went on. \"It's still not real!\"Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.PhotographOn Friday morning, President Trump became the first sitting president to speak in person at the annual March for Life.

The president at different points mused about the Rev. Al Sharpton's weight -- \"He looked better when he was heavy\" -- and the Academy Awards -- \"Seriously, the Academy Awards has gone way, way down in ratings. You know why? Because they started attacking us, and we don't believe in it anymore. That's why.\"But he always found his way back to partisan politics.\"On Jan. 31, I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States,\" Mr. Trump said to loud cheers about his decision to seal the borders to travelers, \"an action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested, and now everybody's complimenting me.\"Experts have questioned the effectiveness of border closures and quarantines when so much about the coronavirus is unknown. Yet Mr. Trump appeared to tie his administration's response with his case for tighter immigration policies: \"We must understand that border security is also health security.\"In recent days, the president has appeared more interested in his prospects for re-election than in conducting a measured response to a public health crisis. On Friday morning, Fox News -- usually a reliable ally -- drew Mr. Trump's ire for releasing polling that showed him faltering in matchups against potential rivals in November.\"Worst Polls, just like in 2016 when they were so far off the mark, are the @FoxNews Polls,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Why doesn't Fox finally get a competent Polling Company?\" (At the rally, he remarked that the unnamed Fox pollster \"hates Trump's guts.\")The Keep America Great rally in South Carolina, a state that Mr. Trump won handily in 2016, was intended to draw attention away from the Democratic primary, scheduled for Saturday. With both of the state's Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, in tow, the president became the latest national politician to visit a state that has been overwhelmed by them.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, both running for the Democratic presidential nomination, are betting that South Carolina will revive their flagging campaigns, and the president had words for them.\"I thought I knew all the wealthy people,\" he said of Mr. Steyer, whom he mocked as \"Mr. Impeachment.\" He then teased Mr. Biden for mixing up the names of states he has visited. \"He did that like seven times,\" Mr. Trump said.\"If I did that once, it would be the end of the road, right?\" he added. \"They'd say Trump has lost it.\"He paused before saying, \"They like to say that anyway, I guess.\"Mr. Trump poll-tested various candidates with the crowd -- \"We won't include Steyer, he's a loser\" -- before disparaging Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as a \"mean one\" and dismissing Michael R. Bloomberg as \"gone\" and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota as \"not going to happen.\" The president then asked his supporters who they thought was the weaker candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Mr. Biden.\"Who the hell is easier to beat? Crazy Bernie? Or Sleepy Joe?\" he said, before concluding that his best chances lie with Mr. Sanders.Among other topics, Mr. Trump assessed his own effectiveness with minority voters, regaling the crowd with a story about a \"love fest\" event at the White House at which he hosted African-Americans. His campaign recently announced a push to open storefronts in swing states targeting black voters with \"Woke\"-themed merchandise and pamphlets.\"One of the things I asked them,\" Mr. Trump said, \"I've been thinking about this for a long time -- great people, some of them are here tonight -- 'Do you like the name African-American or black?' And they said, 'Black!' all at the same time. True. I tell you. Because you say African-American or black. And they said almost, like, immediately, 'Black.\"'On and off the rally stage, the president has zeroed in on Mr. Bloomberg for his performances in recent debates. Earlier Friday, Mr. Trump spread an unfounded Twitter rumor that Mr. Bloomberg was thinking of ending his presidential bid.\"Shouldn't you be worrying about the coronavirus?\" Mr. Bloomberg replied on Twitter. \"Listen to your scientists. Prepare your people. Be the leader America needs. If only just this once.\"The South Carolina rally was just the latest stop on Mr. Trump's grievance roadshow. He has visited every state that has held a primary or caucus so far this year, making trolling Democratic candidates a cornerstone of his re-election campaign strategy.Democrats say that this penchant to chase them around the map is evidence that Mr. Trump is not confident about his chances. But Erin Cassese, a political science researcher at the University of Delaware who studies the psychology of voters, said that the president was capitalizing on the anger felt by Republican voters who have been bombarded with messaging they do not necessarily agree with.\"There's how much you like your own party and then there's almost how much you dislike the opposing party,\" Ms. Cassese said. \"I see Trump as riding the wave of negative partisanship by following Democrats through these early primary states. And the rally is kind of a pressure valve.\"At the rally, Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Graham, a fervent defender of the president's, onstage for a round of praise.\"Do you know why you're going to win?\" the senator asked Mr. Trump. \"You've been a damn good president.\" Mr. Graham then thanked the president for putting up with what the senator described as never-ending obstacles, though Mr. Graham used an expletive instead.Later, as Mr. Trump spoke about immigration, he celebrated a federal appeals court ruling that determined that his administration would not have to provide funding to so-called sanctuary cities, and he recounted in grisly detail stories of an undocumented immigrant who had been arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. He said the man was also a member of the MS-13 gang, a vicious criminal organization.\"He should never have been in our country,\" Mr. Trump said as the crowd roared and started a \"Build the Wall\" chant. \"He should not have been allowed.\"PhotographSupporters cheered as President Donald Trump took the stage Friday night for a rally at an arena in North Charleston, S.C.

Also in attendance were Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and adviser, and Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son.Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said in a statement that state health officials were informed by the New Jersey Department of Health that the person who tested positive for the virus was in Maryland from Feb. 27 to March 1, attending the conference in National Harbor.The statement said those who attended or worked at the conference \"may be at some risk\" for contracting the virus.\"Due to the scale of this conference, we are urging attendees who are experiencing flulike symptoms to immediately reach out to their health care provider,\" Mr. Hogan said.The American Conservative Union said the event drew thousands.The group's chairman, Matt Schlapp, said he had had \"incidental interaction with the person,\" and added, \"I feel bad for my friend who is in the hospital.\"\"We've talked to him,\" Mr. Schlapp said. \"He sounds very good.\"Alexandra Altman, a spokeswoman for Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, says the attendee who tested positive for the coronavirus is a 55-year-old man and lives in Englewood, N.J.Health officials said the man was hospitalized and was in stable condition.At the conference, Mr. Trump gave his administration good grades for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, while his acting chief of staff at the time, Mick Mulvaney, said in a separate speech that journalists were hyping the coronavirus because \"they think this will bring down the president.\"Mr. Mulvaney also minimized concerns over the virus.\"The flu kills people,\" he said. \"This is not Ebola. It's not SARS, it's not MERS. It's not a death sentence; it's not the same as the Ebola crisis.\"Founded in 1974, CPAC was for years a major gathering where libertarians and establishment Republicans mingled with fringe conservative activists. This year, the theme of the conference was \"America vs. Socialism,\" and it turned into a stage for Mr. Trump and his top advisers and allies to fire up his base and market-test messages for the 2020 presidential election.Republicans who have broken with the president and his agenda, like Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, were disinvited from the conference, and the mention of Mr. Romney's name by one conservative speaker elicited boos from the audience.Peter Baker, Annie Karni and Tracey Tully contributed reporting.PhotographOfficials said the attendee who tested positive did not come in contact with President Trump.

Biden Jr. as a feebleminded has-been while fanning resentment among supporters of Bernie Sanders.Traveling to one of the larger states holding a Democratic primary on Super Tuesday, Mr. Trump eagerly sought to undercut Mr. Biden at the very moment the former vice president revived his flagging campaign, taunting him for verbal gaffes and memory lapses and portraying him as an old man who even if elected would not govern but instead be committed to a retirement home.As he has for weeks, the president likewise sought to encourage disenchantment on the left by promoting the notion that the Democratic Party establishment was trying to somehow illegitimately take away the nomination from Mr. Sanders. But Mr. Trump did not neglect the rest of the shrinking Democratic field, firing off barbs at the other candidates still in contention and even those who dropped out in the past 48 hours and threw their support to Mr. Biden.\"The Democrat party has gone crazy,\" Mr. Trump said to a stadium full of cheering supporters.The president wrapped up his rally not long before Mr. Biden's own election-eve rally in Dallas got underway, and Mr. Trump seemed especially focused on the former vice president as a potential opponent in the fall.He gleefully repeated recent misstatements by Mr. Biden, including his confusion over names and states, his statement that he was a candidate for the Senate, his reference to Tuesday's primaries as \"Super Thursday\" and his head-spinning comment that 150 million Americans have been killed by guns since 2007.\"That means 50 percent of our country!\" Mr. Trump said of the gun comment. \"That's a big story!\"\"Sleepy Joe,\" Mr. Trump continued, \"he doesn't even know where he is or what he's doing or what office he's running for. Honestly, I don't think he knows what office he's running for.\"If Mr. Biden won the presidency, Mr. Trump said, his staff would actually do the governing. \"They're going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country,\" the president said, \"and they're going to be super-left, radical crazies. And Joe's going to be in a home and he'll be watching television.\"A revival of Mr. Biden's candidacy could scramble the election dynamics, giving Mr. Trump as much at stake on Tuesday as the Democrats. The president and his staff have been excited by the rise of Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator who calls himself a democratic socialist, seeing the contrast as a favorable one in the November general election. But Mr. Trump made clear he would happily go after Mr. Biden if he emerges, too.The rally in North Carolina was the fifth time in a row that the president has flown to a state holding a Democratic contest just before voting opened to force his way into the news cycle and try to shape the conversation. \"We like to troll,\" he boasted to the crowd in Charlotte.As is often the case, the Monday night rally was more of a Trumpian stream of consciousness than a recitation of the official text sitting on the teleprompter in front of him. He accused Democrats of \"trying to politicize the coronavirus\" even as he focused on the politics of coronavirus and asserted that \"fringe globalists\" wanted to keep the borders open to infected visitors.Mr. Trump peppered his speech with a string of false or misleading statements. \"Mexico's paying for the wall,\" he insisted, even though it is not. \"Yes, they are. You'll see. You'll see. You understand.\" He boasted of preserving protections for pre-existing conditions even though his administration went to court to overturn the law guaranteeing such protections and supported legislation that would have weakened them.As he sometimes does in these off-the-cuff riffs, he trailed off into comments that raised eyebrows. Twice at different points in his speech, he noted that he knew many parents who \"don't love their children very much.\" At another point, he summoned Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, to the stage and gushed over him as if he were a younger brother.\"We all have your back,\" declared Mr. Graham, who lost the Republican presidential nomination to Mr. Trump in 2016, when the senator called the eventual winner a \"kook\" who was unfit for office. \"Mr. President, you're going to kick their ass in November.\"\"Oh, my Lindsey, my Lindsey,\" Mr. Trump said.The president ridiculed the other Democratic candidates, calling former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York \"a disaster waiting to happen\" and \"a mess,\" while again mocking his would-be challenger's height. He recalled how Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom he once again mocked with a racial slur, \"Pocahontas,\" eviscerated Mr. Bloomberg at a recent debate. \"She's mean, she's very mean,\" he said. \"She came after him and he started choking.\"Two candidates who just left the race likewise came under fire: former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Without any evidence, Mr. Trump contended that they made an illicit pact with Mr. Biden for their support.\"Sounds like they made a deal,\" he said. \"They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo. That's why.\" Alluding to his own impeachment for using the power of his office to coerce campaign aid from Ukraine, Mr. Trump shouted: \"Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo!\"He seemed particularly keen on fomenting discord within the Democratic Party by suggesting that the gathering support for Mr. Biden constituted a conspiracy to deny Mr. Sanders the nomination for a second election cycle in a row.\"It's being rigged against Crazy Bernie,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Crazy Bernie's going to go crazy, crazy.\"Maggie Haberman reported from Charlotte, and Peter Baker from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump, speaking in Charlotte, N.C., mocked Joseph R.

Now, he confronts twin challenges in an election year.President Trump entered the new year facing flare-ups of long-burning crises with two old adversaries -- Iran and North Korea -- that are directly challenging his claim to have reasserted American power around the world.While the Iranian-backed attack on the United States Embassy in Baghdad seemed to be under control, it played to Mr. Trump's longtime worry that American diplomats and troops in the Middle East are easy targets and his longtime position that the United States must pull back from the region.In North Korea, Kim Jong-un's declaration on Wednesday that the world would \"witness a new strategic weapon\" seemed to be the end of an 18-month experiment in which Mr. Trump believed his force of personality -- and vague promises of economic development -- would wipe away a problem that plagued the last 12 of his predecessors.The timing of these new challenges is critical: Both the Iranians and the North Koreans seem to sense the vulnerability of a president under impeachment and facing re-election, even if they are often clumsy as they try to play those events to their advantage.The protests in Iraq calmed on Wednesday, and Mr. Kim has not yet unveiled his latest \"strategic weapon.\" But the events of recent days have underscored how much bluster was behind Mr. Trump's boast a year ago that Iran was \"a very different nation\" since he had broken its economy by choking off its oil revenues. They also belied his famous tweet: \"There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.\"Today the most generous thing one could say about those statements is that they were wildly premature. Many foreign policy experts say he fundamentally misjudged the reactions of two major American adversaries. Neither seems to fear him, precisely the critique he leveled at Barack Obama back in the days when Mr. Trump declared America's toughest national security challenges would be solved as soon as a president the world respected was in office.The core problem may have been Mr. Trump's conviction that economic incentives alone -- oil profits in Tehran and the prospect of investment and glorious beach-front hotels in North Korea -- would overcome all other national interests.He dismissed the depth of Iran's determination to re-establish itself as the most powerful force in the region. He also underestimated Mr. Kim's conviction that his nuclear arsenal is his only insurance policy to buoy one of the last family-controlled Stalinist regimes.\"After three years of no international crises,\" Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Tuesday, Mr. Trump is \"facing one with Iran because he has rejected diplomacy and another with North Korea because he has asked too much of diplomacy.\"\"In neither case has Trump embraced traditional diplomacy, putting forward a partial or interim pact in which a degree of restraint would be met with a degree of sanctions relief.\"Mr. Trump does not engage such arguments. He simply repeats his mantra that Iran will never be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons and that North Korea -- which already has fuel for upward of 40 of them, much of it produced on Mr. Trump's watch -- has committed to full denuclearization, even though that overstates Mr. Kim's position.His top national security officials, starting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, offer a somewhat more nuanced view, saying that over time Iran will realize it has no choice but to change its ways and expressing optimism that \"Chairman Kim will make the right decision and he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war.\"Increasingly, though, such lines sound like a hope, not a strategy. That is Mr. Trump's fundamental problem as he enters 2020. He does not have a comprehensive plan to unite the nation's estranged allies into a concerted course of action.The absence of a common approach is hurting the most in Iran. When Mr. Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal -- declaring it a \"terrible\" piece of Obama-era diplomacy because it did not create permanent restraints on Iran's ability to produce nuclear fuel -- his aides sounded confident that Europe, China and Russia would follow suit. They did not.Europe has flailed in its efforts to counteract American sanctions against Iran, but has insisted that the deal remains in place, even though both Washington and Tehran are violating key aspects of it.Russia and China have taken the next step. Last week they opened joint naval exercises with Iran in the Gulf of Oman. The exercises were not militarily significant, and the three nations have plenty of differences. But to the Iranians, the military drills symbolized having two nuclear-armed superpowers on their side.Vice Admiral Gholamreza Tahani of Iran was quoted in the Financial Times declaring that \"the most important achievement of these drills\" was the message \"that the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot be isolated.\"It is possible that the Trump administration's strategy will still bear fruit: Mr. Pompeo was doing everything he could in recent weeks to express support for Iranians who were mounting protests inside their own country. But the history of past protests -- most notably in 2009 -- offers little hope that they can threaten the government. Hundreds of protesters appear to have been killed by internal security forces this time.The Iranians have a fine sense that \"maximum pressure\" campaigns work in both directions. They are vulnerable to cutoffs in oil flows. But the United States is vulnerable to highly public attacks on troops and tankers.The attack on the outer walls of the American Embassy in Baghdad, even if short-lived, was clearly intended to send a shiver down the spine of Mr. Trump's political aides, who remember well that a hostage crisis helped lead to President Jimmy Carter's re-election defeat 40 years ago.In recent months, Iran has repeatedly mounted a strike and pulled back, including its attacks on oil tankers, an American drone and Saudi oil facilities.The Iranians have made clear what Mr. Trump needs to do to reopen negotiations: Essentially return to the deal struck with Mr. Obama, largely by lifting sanctions Mr. Trump imposed starting in May 2018. There are signs Mr. Trump is eager to resume talks, including his effort to lure President Hassan Rouhani to the phone when the Iranian leader was in New York in September for United Nations meetings.That diplomatic initiative will doubtless continue in secret. But the Iranians have found new leverage in the ability to turn anti-Iran protests in Iraq into protests against American troops, complete with Iran's signature \"death to America\" street chants.On Tuesday, he revived an old talking point, emphasizing that he did not want a war but warning Iran that any conflict \"wouldn't last very long.\"North Korea is a harder problem because Mr. Trump had initiated a bold and imaginative diplomatic process with Mr. Kim. By breaking the mold and agreeing to meet the North Korean leader face to face, he would be the first American president to do so since the end of the Korean War.But he made key mistakes. He failed to get a nuclear freeze agreement from the North in return for the meeting, meaning that the country's nuclear and missile production continued to churn along.Mr. Trump's team, internally divided, could not back itself out of the corner the president created with his vow of no serious sanctions relief until the arsenal was disbanded. Mr. Trump did cancel joint military exercises with South Korea -- over Pentagon objections -- but that was not enough for Mr. Kim.Perhaps Mr. Trump's biggest miscalculation was over-relying on the personal rapport he built with Mr. Kim, and overinterpreting the commitments he received from the young, wily North Korean leader.That continues. At a news conference on his way to a New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago club, the president focused on their relationship, as if Mr. Kim's declaration that he was no longer bound by any commitment to cease missile and nuclear testing did not exist. \"He likes me, I like him, we get along,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's representing his country, I'm representing my country. We have to do what we have to do.\"Then he misrepresented the agreement he reached with Mr. Kim during their meeting in Singapore in June 2018, describing it as if it were a real estate deal. \"But he did sign a contract,\" Mr. Trump said of the vague declaration of principles they agreed on.In fact, it was not a contract, it had no binding force and it referred to the \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" That phrase means something very different in Pyongyang than it does in Washington: It means the North expects the United States to pull back its own nuclear-backed forces, including submarines and ships that can deliver such weapons to the peninsula.So now Mr. Trump finds himself awaiting a new missile test.It may be a solid-fuel, intercontinental missile, according to some experts, to show that the North has finally mastered a weapon that can be rolled out and launched with little warning. And it may carry some kind of payload to demonstrate that the country now knows how to make a warhead that can withstand re-entry into the atmosphere, a difficult technology.But buried in Mr. Kim's New Year's statement was a suggestion of what he really had in mind: talks with the United States about the \"scope and depth\" of the North's nuclear force. That means he really is not interested in denuclearization at all. He is interested in arms-control talks, like the United States conducted for decades with the Kremlin.And arms control, of course, would achieve what Mr. Kim, his father and his grandfather all sought: that insurance policy for the family.PhotographThe attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad underscored President Trump's concerns about diplomats and troops in the region.

The group silently marched two charges of high crimes and misdemeanors, encased in slim blue folders, across the Capitol to set in motion the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.The proceedings commencing on Thursday will play out in a Capitol already rived by politics during a contentious election year. Among the senators who will be sitting in judgment of Mr. Trump will be four Democrats who are running for president, juggling their campaigns to defeat him with their duties as jurors.The trial is laden with peril for Mr. Trump. He will face weeks of public discussion of the allegations that he solicited foreign help in the 2020 presidential election, abusing the power of his office and obstructing a congressional inquiry in the process. But the president is almost certain to cast his likely acquittal as a complete exoneration and turn the considerable apparatus of his campaign to stoke public outrage.Democrats believe the proceeding will put pressure on Republicans -- particularly those facing tough re-election challenges -- to condemn Mr. Trump or risk being cast as an apologist for the president. Yet they, too, risk a backlash if voters sour on the impeachment effort, dismissing it as a political stunt.\"We are here today to cross a very important threshold in American history,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi said as she spoke on the House floor before a vote to transmit the articles. Regardless of the outcome, she added, Mr. Trump would be \"impeached for life.\"The House impeached Mr. Trump last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, formally accusing him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political opponents while withholding as leverage a nearly $400 million package of military assistance and a White House meeting with the country's president.Wednesday's vote, almost exactly a month later, was largely along party lines. Only one Democrat, Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, joined every Republican in voting \"no.\"The action deputized the seven impeachment managers who will present the House's case. The group, mostly lawyers, included a former police chief and reflected the geographic and demographic diversity of the Democratic caucus, with three women, two African-Americans and one Latina.Hours later, after an elaborate signing ceremony, they walked two by two through a hushed Capitol, carrying the articles -- embossed with a gold seal and bearing the signatures of Ms. Pelosi and the House clerk -- to the Senate. More than two dozen Democrats, but only two Republicans -- Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota -- sat in the chamber awaiting their arrival.At the White House, the president denounced the effort to remove him anew as a \"hoax\" that Republicans would soon debunk -- \"let's take care of it,\" he told members of the House attending a ceremony in the East Room not long before the vote. Senior administration officials projected confidence, calling theirs an \"easy case\" and predicting that the Senate would acquit the president in two weeks without hearing from any witnesses.But the path ahead in the Senate was far from clear, as the normally staid chamber braced for a potentially fractious proceeding and some Republicans agitated for a lengthier and more thorough process.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, confirmed that she and a small group of fellow Republicans -- Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mitt Romney of Utah -- had worked with Mr. McConnell to ensure there would be a vote on whether to call witnesses or collect new documentary evidence, once each side had presented its case and senators had a chance to ask questions.\"It's important that we have an up-or-down vote on the issue of subpoenaing witnesses and documents,\" Ms. Collins told reporters, \"and I've worked very hard to get that included, with all my colleagues that I've mentioned, into the governing resolution.\"The president himself is \"of two minds\" on the matter, said Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, saying that Mr. Trump was vacillating between wanting a prolonged trial with a robust public defense of his actions and a quick dismissal.\"I think he feels that he's been unjustly accused, and would like to present his side of it,\" Mr. Paul said in an interview on Wednesday. But he added, \"I think it's hard to sort of turn down the idea that we could have a motion to end this thing.\"Mr. McConnell accepted the articles late Wednesday afternoon and invited the managers to exhibit them at noon Thursday. The Senate will then summon Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who will preside over the trial, to administer an oath binding senators to render \"impartial justice\" and issue a summons asking the president to answer to the charges against him.The trial, however, will not begin in earnest until Tuesday, with debate on a resolution to set the rules followed by opening arguments by the House managers and the president's legal team.After weeks of sharp words, Mr. McConnell sounded an unusually somber note on the Senate floor, in a nod to the weight of the occasion.\"This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate,\" he said. \"I'm confident this body can rise above the short term-ism and factional fever and serve the long-term best interests of our nation. We can do this and we must.\"Ms. Pelosi withheld the articles from trial for nearly a month to try to increase pressure on Republicans like Ms. Collins to vote for new evidence. Democrats argued aggressively that a trial without it is tantamount to an extension of Mr. Trump's attempts to cover up his actions.Pressing their case, just as lawmakers were preparing to transfer the articles across the Capitol, the House made public another tranche of newly received texts, calendar entries, notes and other records illustrating aspects of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine that could be used by prosecutors in the trial.They came from Lev Parnas, an associate of Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and appeared to detail attempts to dig up dirt in Ukraine on Mr. Trump's political rivals, actions that lie at the heart of the House's case. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Parnas asserted that Mr. Trump had been fully aware of his efforts, though the two men never spoke about it.\"Time has been our friend in all of this because it has yielded incriminating evidence, more truth into the public domain,\" Ms. Pelosi told reporters.To lead the team of managers to prosecute the case, Ms. Pelosi turned to one of her most tested deputies, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the House's Ukraine inquiry as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.The group also includes Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; Zoe Lofgren of California, a veteran of three presidential impeachment debates; Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a fast-rising Democratic leader and the party's messaging chief; Val B. Demings of Florida, a former police chief; and Jason Crow of Colorado and Sylvia R. Garcia of Texas.Several of the lawmakers have courtroom experience of some kind, a quality Ms. Pelosi said she had sought. Two, Mr. Crow and Ms. Garcia, are both first-term members, and Mr. Crow has military experience allowing him to speak to the national security implications of some of Mr. Trump's actions.The managers met for the first time as a group on Wednesday to discuss strategy in the basement chambers of the Intelligence Committee, where the impeachment inquiry unfolded last fall.In the coming days and weeks, the managers will try to lift their arguments against Mr. Trump above ordinary politics. Like Mr. Trump's defense team, they will aim their case not only at the 100 senators gathered at trial but at voters who will go to the ballot box in November and serve as the ultimate appeals court on Mr. Trump's presidency.They will seek to recreate the highlights of the two-month investigation of the Ukraine matter, relying on testimony from more than a dozen senior American diplomats and White House officials who defied the president's orders not to cooperate.Those witnesses outlined a broad campaign by Mr. Trump to use the levers of his government to exert pressure on Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and claims that the Democrats colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 election. The president, the House concluded, ultimately withheld the military aid earmarked for Ukraine and a coveted White House meeting for its new leader as leverage.But the managers must also contend anew with Mr. Trump's successful stonewalling. His across-the-board refusal to produce documents or top aides to investigators resulted in the second impeachment charge, obstruction of Congress, but also holes in the factual record that the senators have already made clear they will call into question.\"This trial is necessary because President Trump gravely abused the power of his office when he strong-armed a foreign government to announce investigations into his domestic political rival,\" Mr. Nadler said during a brief debate on the House floor before the vote. \"But we still have not heard the whole truth.\"Republican leaders on both sides of the Capitol appeared unmoved. Mr. McConnell called the House's three-month Ukraine investigation \"a pale imitation of a real inquiry.\" Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, called the whole process a \"national nightmare.\"Emily Cochrane and Annie Karni contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, center, with the House's new impeachment managers, said, \"We are here today to cross a very important threshold in American history.\" (PHOTOGRAPH BY ANNA MONEYMAKER/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A12)Word count: 1703Show lessYou have requested \"on-the-fly\" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

The move consolidated the position of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and adviser, and signaled the waning influence of Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff.Ms. Hicks will serve as a counselor to the president, reporting to Mr. Kushner. Her return to the president's side after his acquittal in the impeachment inquiry is an indication that Mr. Trump is seeking to reassemble as best he can the small, intensely devoted team of family members and friends who helped guide him to an improbable victory in 2016.Johnny McEntee, the \"body man\" who trailed Mr. Trump as a candidate and in the White House, will be elevated to oversee the Presidential Personnel Office, according to four people briefed on the move. Mr. McEntee, who was forced from his job in 2018 over gambling debts that threatened his security clearance, recently returned to his old role as a personal aide to Mr. Trump.The West Wing changes came just hours before Attorney General William P. Barr issued a remarkable rebuke of Mr. Trump, saying the president's attacks on the Justice Department over the case of Roger J. Stone Jr. made it \"impossible for me to do my job\" and asserting that \"I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody.\"Earlier Thursday, Mr. Trump engaged in an hourslong series of rants on Twitter and in a radio interview, hurling insults and unproved accusations in a tirade that rivaled his most grievance-filled moments since becoming president.In rapid-fire fashion, Mr. Trump alleged bias from a juror in the trial of Mr. Stone, his longtime friend, and belittled John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff, as an ineffective aide who \"misses the action & just can't keep his mouth shut.\" In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Kelly had defended Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the decorated national security official who testified in the impeachment inquiry and was removed from his job last week.The president said Colonel Vindman's exit from the White House -- he was escorted out by security officers -- was applauded by \"the whole building.\" Moments later, Mr. Trump mocked the physical stature of Michael R. Bloomberg, a Democratic candidate for president and the former mayor of New York.\"Mini Mike is a 5'4\" mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians,\" Mr. Trump said, sneering at the idea that Mr. Bloomberg might stand on a box during a debate. \"No boxes please.\" Mr. Bloomberg is actually 5-foot-7.Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has already spent more than $350 million in his bid for the Democratic nomination, wasted no time returning fire at the man he hopes to face in November's election.\"We know many of the same people in NY,\" he wrote. \"Behind your back they laugh at you & call you a carnival barking clown. They know you inherited a fortune & squandered it with stupid deals and incompetence. I have the record & the resources to defeat you. And I will.\"In his speech at Drew University in New Jersey, first reported by The Atlantic, Mr. Kelly said that Colonel Vindman was right to raise questions about a telephone call with the president of Ukraine in which Mr. Trump pressed for investigations into his political rivals.\"He did exactly what we teach them to do from cradle to grave,\" Mr. Kelly said. \"He went and told his boss of what he just heard. We teach them: 'Don't follow an illegal order. And if you're ever given one, you'll raise it to whoever gives it to you that this is an illegal order, and then you'll tell your boss.\"'The remarks drew a swift response from the president, who tweeted on Thursday morning that Mr. Kelly, who served as the chief of staff for 17 months before resigning early last year, was \"way over his head\" in the job. He also suggested that Mr. Kelly's public comments violated a \"military and legal obligation\" to remain silent.John R. Bolton, the president's former national security adviser, who clashed with Mr. Kelly when the two were White House colleagues, came to his defense. Mr. Kelly has \"always served his country faithfully,\" Mr. Bolton said in a statement, and called on conservatives to \"reject baseless attacks upon him.\"In the radio interview with Geraldo Rivera, Mr. Trump also renewed his attacks on Colonel Vindman, describing him as \"very insubordinate\" and claiming that Colonel Vindman's colleagues applauded his departure last Friday.\"Vindman was the guy that, when we took him out of the building, the whole building applauded,\" Mr. Trump said. A senior National Security Council official said later that Mr. Trump's description was accurate, but did not say he had firsthand knowledge of it.David Pressman, a lawyer for Colonel Vindman, did not address a question about the applause, but said in a statement that the \"continued public attacks by the president of the United States on an active-duty officer in the military are designed to intimidate and to punish.\" He added, \"By using the power of his office to repeatedly humiliate and punish those following the law, the president is encouraging breaking the law.\"Mr. Trump also suggested during the radio interview that he could stop the tradition of allowing numerous national security officials to listen to his phone calls with foreign leaders, as Colonel Vindman did with the Ukraine call. \"I may end the practice,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I may end it entirely.\"The changes at the White House will bring familiar faces back to the West Wing. Always obsessed with the threat of leaks, Mr. Trump has become more concerned about loyalty since a whistle-blower came forward last year to express concerns about the Ukraine call.Ms. Hicks, 31, worked on Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign from its inception and followed him to the White House, eventually becoming communications director. Her return will come as his re-election campaign intensifies and as his advisers say the superstitious president has talked about recreating some aspects of that first race.Ms. Hicks's title when she left belied her influence with Mr. Trump, who felt more personal comfort with her than with almost any other adviser. A senior administration official said that Ms. Hicks would work on projects that Mr. Kushner oversees, including the re-election campaign. She will not rejoin the communications office.\"There is no one more devoted to implementing President Trump's agenda than Hope Hicks,\" Mr. Kushner said in a statement. \"We are excited to have her back on the team.\"Ms. Hicks's time with Mr. Trump began when she was working as an aide for his elder daughter, Ivanka Trump, on her fashion brand. He hired her for his skeleton staff when he began his campaign for president in 2015, and because the campaign was so small, Ms. Hicks was constantly at Mr. Trump's side.Since last fall, Ms. Hicks had been working as the chief communications officer at Fox.Eileen Sullivan and Michael Crowley contributed reporting.PhotographJohn F. Kelly, the former White House chief of staff, was a target of President Trump's ire.

But not all Republicans are convinced.MANCHESTER, N.H. -- In 2016, Donald J. Trump came within a few thousand votes of winning New Hampshire in the general election. This time around, fueled by a stockpile of donations, his campaign is looking at New Hampshire and its four electoral votes as a key target in its efforts to expand the map.There are some factors working in his favor. Instead of a feud with one of the Republican Party's few female senators as well as a former governor, the president has the state party apparatus backing him. And his advisers think the policies he has implemented fit the contours of the state.But securing victory in a state that has been won by a Democrat in every presidential election since 2000 will be a test of both the president's durability and his political operation.Mr. Trump's allies say the issues are with him. The unemployment rate in the state was 2.6 percent in October 2019, lower than the national figure. Mr. Trump has highlighted his administration's efforts to stem the opioid crisis in a state that continues to rank among the top five in opioid-related deaths.The president's new North American trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, affects New Hampshire businesses importing timber, syrup and dairy from Canada, campaign officials said. Officials also pointed to efforts by the Interior Department to eliminate the Seamounts Marine National Monument, located off the Atlantic Coast, as a move that appeals to New Hampshire voters because it could open up previously protected areas to commercial uses like fishing.Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's first 2016 campaign manager and a New Hampshire resident who considered running for the Senate seat held by the Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, said that those factors, \"coupled with the fact that the president should have won last time,\" work in his favor -- an apparent reference to the relatively little party support Mr. Trump had in his losing battle with Hillary Clinton.Yet if the New Hampshire Republican Party now belongs to the president, it has also seen a significant decline in enrollment.\"New Hampshire is going to be a challenge for him to win in November,\" said Jennifer Horn, the former New Hampshire Republican chairman and a staunch critic of Mr. Trump. \"A week ago, we had more than 20,000 fewer registered Republicans than there were Election Day in 2016.\"Ms. Horn noted that Republican candidates lost large, consistently red areas in the 2018 midterm elections, and that the same thing could happen here to Mr. Trump. While other state Republicans played down concerns about the drop in party members on the voter rolls as the natural ebb and flow that happens in a state with same-day voter registration, Ms. Horn said 20,000 was \"way outside the norm.\"And the state's demographics reflect the type of place where Mr. Trump will face challenges: concentrations of working-class whites, but multitudes of college-educated voters, who polls show have been abandoning the Republican Party.\"We've had great success in the municipal elections, and of course we had the historic wins in 2018,\" said Ray Buckley, the state Democratic chairman. \"There's a lot of energy on the ground here. We've built a year-round organization.\"Aware of some of the challenges ahead, the Trump campaign appears eager to get a head start.While Pete Buttigieg was trying to emerge from the Democratic field and Joseph R. Biden Jr. was trying to stay in it, Mr. Trump turned up in Manchester for a rally Monday night and Trump surrogates fanned out Tuesday to diners and polling sites throughout the state, even though he faces only token opposition in the Republican primary.Their mission: talk up Mr. Trump's policies, distract attention from Democrats and set the stage for the general election.\"We're trying to fly the Trump flag when all the action is on the other side,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who strolled into Bedford High School, just outside Manchester, to greet voters on Tuesday morning. \"If the economy stays good, I think he's very much in play here.\"Senator Rick Scott of Florida was on hand outside Manchester on Tuesday morning to paint Democrats with the brush of \"socialism.\" Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, spent the day at diners and high schools campaigning for his father. Representatives Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Greg Pence of Indiana, among others, stayed behind after Mr. Trump's rally on Monday night and made diner visits and talked with local news media.Two supporters who were scheduled to campaign on the ground for him -- Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida -- hitched a ride home Monday night on Air Force One instead, to deal with legislative matters in Washington or attend the transfer of remains for two soldiers killed over the weekend in Afghanistan. Taking their place were prominent New Hampshire Republicans, a change from four years ago.Gov. Chris Sununu bound into a local high school, where he purchased a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts from a student bake sale and stayed on message.\"The Trump tax cuts here worked,\" he said. \"The U.S.M.C.A., very powerful, for a lot of our businesses that trade with our friends to the north. The regulatory reform streamlined the process.\" He also credited the administration with investing $50 million in the state to battle the opioid crisis.The last time Mr. Trump was running, John H. Sununu, the current governor's father and a former governor himself, questioned Mr. Trump's history of business losses and said his coarse language was \"demeaning of the office he's seeking.\"Trump campaign officials said they blamed the president's 2016 loss in large part on his feud with Kelly Ayotte, a senator at the time who was locked in a close re-election race and tried to thread the needle by saying she would vote for Mr. Trump but not endorse him. Ms. Ayotte lost her seat, and Mr. Trump lost the state, an outcome one campaign official described as a political murder-suicide.Monday found Ms. Ayotte campaigning for the president at a \"Cops for Trump\" event with Ivanka Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Reached on the phone on Tuesday, Ms. Ayotte hung up on a reporter. \"I'm busy. I have to go,\" she said when asked to comment on the state of the race in New Hampshire.But the show of Republican force appeared to be having its desired effect of sparking fears among Democratic voters about the strength of their own candidates.Mark Goodridge, 75, of Bedford, said he was voting for Mr. Biden. But he said he was anxious that he might lose to Mr. Trump.\"You see the Trump signs out there? Did you see how many are out there?\" he asked, pointing to the pop-up stand of Trump campaign T-shirts and gear set up outside the school's entrance.His wife, Margaret, 76, chimed in. \"I think it depends on who the Democrats pick,\" she said. \"If we get the right candidate ... \" Her voice trailed off, before she added, \"Which is kind of a worry.\"PhotographPresident Trump on Monday in New Hampshire, which has been won by a Democrat in every presidential election since 2000.

The president's behavior, in the view of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, left House Democrats with \"no choice\" but to impeach.But what do the American people think?With the Senate trial of Mr. Trump now underway, we deployed a team of journalists to find out. We contacted hundreds of voters who had responded to an online survey saying they would be willing to be interviewed. We reached 81 people, from nearly 30 states.They were Democrats, Republicans and independents. They were retirees and real estate agents, teachers and stay-at-home parents. The youngest was 21; the oldest was 82. Even before the opening statements at the trial had begun, most had already made up their minds on their preferred verdict.As one independent voter from Ohio put it, \"maybe they should ask the people what they should do. It should be our vote.\"Though the case against Mr. Trump is complex, most people grasp the basics.The last time a president was impeached, in the 1990s, the allegations were like something out of a soap opera: President Bill Clinton was accused of lying under oath about his sexual encounters with a White House intern.This time around, the charges stem from something much more complicated and less familiar than a sex scandal: using the power of the presidency to extract foreign help against a domestic rival.We wondered how closely Americans were following the complicated case. \"I think it's about them interfering with the election or something? I'm not sure. It's very confusing,\" said one Republican who didn't think the evidence was very strong. One Democrat who thought Mr. Trump should be removed acknowledged, \"I don't really know what the evidence is.\"But most people, across the political spectrum, were well versed in the basics, and some could even reel off names of key witnesses and documents.Here are some of their descriptions of the case, in their own words.The accusation is that he withheld foreign aid money in exchange for Ukrainians investigating Joe Biden and his son. Kyle Sims, 46, a Republican from North CarolinaThere are two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Bill Oberjohn, 82, a Democrat from OhioSupposedly he was colluding, or he was proposing to the leaders of -- I can't think of the name of the country. Not Czechoslovakia. Joe Biden and his son had gotten involved a few years ago in the Ukraine. It's the Ukraine, right? Tim Tucker, 73, a conservative independent who splits his time between Indiana and FloridaGoing to Ukraine and asking their government for interference for our election and digging up dirt on a political opponent. Bottom line, he was asking for the quid pro quo. Melissa Reese, 32, a Democrat from Allentown, Pa.I'm confused on what they're accusing him of, but it just has to do with the communication with the Ukrainian president. They haven't been able to glom onto anything yet and this was as close as they could get after all the pressure that they've gotten. Amy, 47, a Republican from IllinoisOne side sees impeachment as a ploy in a wider partisan war against Mr. Trump.People we spoke with who said they did not want Mr. Trump to be removed from office tended to view impeachment as an intensely personal attack on the president, mounted by Democrats who despise Mr. Trump and resent his election victory in 2016.I'm convinced of my view because of the blatant disrespect that President Trump has been shown by those who oppose him. It seems as though they would have him impeached at any cost, with no regard to truth or proper proceedings. Bethany McGraw, 21, a Republican from FloridaThey just don't like the man because he's not a politician. They can't reconcile their 2016 defeat of a career politician by a businessman. They can't stand it that he's outthinking them and outmaneuvering them on every issue. Gerald Wilson, 50, a conservative Democrat from OklahomaI think the whole thing is ridiculous. You can tell that the Democrats are just out to get Trump. It's just obvious. I feel like there's no grounds to impeach him. It's just insane. Cherece Mendieta, 46, a conservative from HoustonAs a former law enforcement officer, there is no case there. Absolutely no case. The president did not do anything wrong. It's a shame that so many people hate the president to the point where they will try to make the case where there is none. Bill Marcy, 73, a Republican from MississippiThe other side sees the Ukraine allegations as just the tip of the iceberg.For Democrats and others who said they want the president removed, asking about the freezing of military aid to Ukraine was like opening a Pandora's box of other presidential decisions they disagreed with -- and, in some cases, thought could be impeachable offenses in their own right.I'm upset with the Democrats. They should have listed about 50 things. They should have just buried him. I think that he's guilty of crimes against humanity with regard to immigrants. Now that it's come out that he planned six weeks ago to commit an assassination on a foreign national, to me that's an international crime. Terry Scott, 55, a liberal from Kent, Wash.This is bigger than this particular case -- his mental ramblings, his strong support of strongmen in other countries, his completely flouting the democracy that we have. He's polarizing the nation, putting children in cages. There are so many reasons, but right now, I support that they are impeaching him for obstructing Congress and trying to do their job. Gina Fields, 54, a Democrat from Los AngelesWe have a very big character issue with him. He's made fun of people, he's attacked people's ethnicity, he's attacked people's capabilities, especially making fun of people who might have severe learning issues. He name-calls. Yes, the economy is doing well and he's going to take all of the credit, and I don't know if that is right or wrong. But I think we are at the worst possible time, in terms of the divisiveness of the country, that we have been in my lifetime. Jimmy Welch, 53, a Republican from Louisville, Ky., who voted for President Trump in 2016 but is considering voting against him in 2020I think those are the ones that the House thought would stick, but I do think he's been doing a pretty bad job locally and internationally. His use of hate speech in order to rally supporters. Him closing the borders. America was a country that was built on immigration in the beginning. Desiré Hardison, 37, a Democrat from New York CityI believe even before this case came up to the attention of the American people, Trump's rhetoric on immigration, linking south border refugees to criminals, is an invitation to incite riots and frontiersman's approach to justice. That was enough to be considered a high crime in my mind. Yin Yeh, 81, a liberal Democrat from CaliforniaNot everything is partisan. Sometimes it's complicated.Over all, our interviews captured views of impeachment that largely break along partisan lines. But at the same time, they also offered a refreshing reminder that people are complicated, and often defy political and demographic stereotypes.Would you have guessed that the 21-year-old we mentioned was a Republican, and the 82-year-old a Democrat?When we asked people where they got their news, many cited outlets that aligned with their political bents. But others listed an array of sometimes contradictory sources, like the moderate who said his media diet included both MSNBC, with its liberal-leaning prime-time opinion shows, and a podcast by the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. One California man in his 70s told us he gets almost all his information from YouTube.And we found that negative feelings about Mr. Trump did not always translate into a desire to see him impeached.The Senate should probably not remove him from office at this point. Probably his misdeeds do not amount to high crimes and misdemeanors, and the uproar from his supporters would dislocate life in the U.S. for years. Terry Morrison, 82, a Democrat from WisconsinAs far as news goes, I've got CNN right next to Fox News on my Sirius satellite. William Johnson, 50, a conservative from TexasHas he done inappropriate things? Yeah, I hate to tell you, every president has. I don't like the man personally. I can understand why they don't like him. But that's not grounds for impeachment. Richard Thomas, 73, a Republican from Avondale, Ariz.I don't think he should've been elected in the first place, but I think it's bad for an impeachment to be this close to an election. He should not be removed. William Hogan, 35, a moderate from AtlantaAnd finally, a few choice outtakes.You've got me fired up here on a Wednesday afternoon. I have to go visit a 100-year-old lady that's in the nursing home. Mr. Tucker, a retiree whom we caught between golf rounds in FloridaI can say, damn near everything I've ever been accused of, I did it. Jonathan Swenson, 38, from Utah, who says he originally registered Republican but isn't so sure nowFiona Hill -- that would be a great name for an alternative band. Jerry Iannacci, 52, an independent from Pennsylvania, praising an impeachment witnessIf you can think of some way to bring America back together, I would pat you on the back and give you an award. Mary Moerles, 73, a conservative independent from MissouriMethodology: We obtained a list of more than 1,000 people who had responded to an online survey and said they were voters and were willing to be interviewed by a reporter. We reached out to several hundred of those voters -- covering a wide range of ages, races and ethnicities, political leanings and home states -- and conducted interviews with 81 of them; their views are presented here. Quotations were edited for brevity and clarity. The interviews do not constitute a scientific sampling of opinion.PhotographThe impeachment proceedings against the president, from the early investigation to the trial that started this week, have animated people in Battle Creek, Mich., at far left, Doylestown, Pa., at right, and many other places besides.

But it drew the line on interfering with the national census.WASHINGTON -- Facebook said on Thursday that it had removed misleading ads run by President Trump's re-election campaign about the 2020 census, in a stand against disinformation ahead of the decennial population count that begins next week.Earlier this week, Trump Make America Great Again, a joint fund-raising arm of Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and the Republican National Committee, started running ads on the social media site that Facebook said could have caused confusion about the timing of the census.\"President Trump needs you to take the Official 2020 Congressional District Census today. We need to hear from you before the most important election in American history,\" the ad said. The campaign asked followers to \"respond NOW\" to help our campaign messaging strategy, with an appeal to text \"TRUMP to 8022.\"The Census Bureau will not begin to survey the public for its population survey until next week. The ad linked the census to the Trump campaign, a misrepresentation of the official government survey, said civil rights groups.The census has become another disinformation test for social media companies. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have come under pressure for their handling of political speech and what has been a piecemeal approach to policing their platforms. Candidates in this year's presidential election are expected to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on political ads, and the companies have already struggled to enforce consistent policies.Facebook has taken the most permissive -- and most criticized -- approach to political speech, allowing candidates and their campaigns to post misleading information and target those messages to specific audiences.When Mr. Trump posted an altered video of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Facebook and Twitter refused to take the video down. A 30-second video ad on Facebook in October also falsely accused former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of blackmailing Ukrainian officials to stop an investigation of his son.But Facebook said on Thursday that the Trump campaign's message violated its policy against interference in the census, an important survey and population count used to draw electoral maps. Facebook bars the misrepresentation of dates, locations, times and methods for census participation.\"There are policies in place to prevent confusion around the official U.S. census and this is an example of those being enforced,\" Facebook said in a statement.President Trump's re-election campaign declined to comment on the ads.The decision to remove the ads was an exception to Facebook's lenient political speech policy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said last fall in a speech at Georgetown University that his company would not arbitrate the harms of speech from political leaders. The speech drew strong criticism from civil rights groups and some Democrats.Facebook does maintain some exceptions to its policy on political speech, including a ban on hate speech and speech that could interfere with the census.Civil rights groups, which have been warning Facebook about the possibility of disinformation around the census, alerted Facebook to the misleading ads Wednesday evening. Judd Legum, a reporter for the newsletter Popular Information, first reported about the ads by Mr. Trump's campaign.At first, Facebook declined to remove Mr. Trump's campaign ads on the census, according to Mr. Legum and Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference Education Fund. Ms. Gupta said she communicated over email on Thursday morning with Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. The company changed its position by Thursday afternoon, she said.Ms. Gupta has warned that the social network could be a target for misinformation on census information, a concern among civil rights leaders, who fear a miscount of the population could affect districting for voters and lead to voter suppression.\"While we're gratified that Facebook shut down Trump's attempt to sow confusion about how and when to participate in the 2020 census, it's disturbing that the ads weren't immediately removed,\" Ms. Gupta said in a statement. \"We will continue to hold Facebook accountable to enforce it. Nothing should distract from making sure everyone gets counted.\"Other civil rights leaders said the delay in action by Facebook showed weakness in its own enforcement. They added that the social media network was not being proactive enough and had placed the burden on the public to inform them about abuses on the site.\"While Facebook has now committed to removing the misinforming post in question, the damage is done,\" said Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, a civil rights group. \"Going forward, harmful and misleading ads must be flagged in a pre-posting review process, not after they've hit hundreds, if not thousands, of news feeds,\"PhotographFacebook bars false dates, locations and methods for census participation.

Bloomberg's remarks to a group of supporters. \"Mini Mike Bloomberg. I agree!\"And by the time the president landed in Colorado Springs for a \"Keep America Great\" rally, on the third day of his trip out West, he seemed interested in taking a victory lap.\"I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate,\" Mr. Trump said shortly after he took the stage. \"It got very big ratings, and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do very well last night. I was going to send him a note saying, 'It's not easy doing what I do, is it?\"'Indeed, at times during the rally, it was difficult to follow exactly what it was he was doing during the 90-plus minutes he spent onstage.During a free-associative speech, Mr. Trump directed an aide to bring him a sheaf of news clippings, reminisced at length about his 2016 victory, criticized windmills and provided xenophobic pop culture commentary. He criticized the movie \"Parasite\" for winning Best Picture at the Academy Awards -- \"The winner is a movie from South Korea? What the hell was that all about?\" -- before calling the actor Brad Pitt \"a little wise guy.\"Eventually, the president found his way back to the slate of Democratic presidential candidates, saving special ire for Mr. Bloomberg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. He said that both of them had \"choked\" on the debate stage. And at one point, Mr. Trump put his hands to his throat and said, \"I can't breathe.\"Though a spate of recent polls show the president faring badly against possible Democratic opponents, including Mr. Bloomberg and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Trump and his advisers say the contentious debate left them feeling bullish about the president's re-election prospects, especially with the impeachment phase of his presidency behind him. In Colorado, Mr. Trump instructed his supporters to ignore the polling.\"Don't believe stories and don't believe polls,\" the president said, \"because the polls are worse than the stories.\"Mr. Trump spent a substantial amount of time regaling the crowd with stories of his 2016 campaign, calling Dan Scavino -- his social media manager and \"the most powerful man in politics,\" the president said -- up to the stage to hand him a stack of news clippings. The president read aloud from them individually, insulting journalists who had declared he had done poorly on the debate stage against Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent that year, and attacking Fox News personalities he considers too critical of him.\"I did great in the debates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I became president because of the debates.\"At the Colorado rally, he was expected to try to bolster the fortunes of Senator Cory Gardner, a vulnerable Republican up for re-election in a state that is trending increasingly liberal. \"You're going to help get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100 percent,\" he told the crowd.Democrats have pointed out that the president's track record on lending support to embattled candidates is mixed at best. But Mr. Trump is practiced at trying to turn any anti-Trump words spoken by Democrats against them, as he did when he paid particular attention to remarks that Mr. Bloomberg delivered to supporters on Thursday morning at an event in Salt Lake City.\"Look, the real winner in the debate last night was Donald Trump because I worry that we may be on the way to nominating somebody who cannot win in November,\" Mr. Bloomberg said. \"If we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base, like Senator Sanders, it will be a fatal error.\"Mr. Bloomberg's somewhat chastened reaction was the cherry on top for the president, who has spent most of the week drawing energy -- and money -- from enthusiastic supporters. According to a Trump campaign official, Mr. Trump has raised $17 million for his re-election efforts since arriving on the West Coast.\"America likes winners, not whiners,\" Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president and a former Trump campaign manager, said of his post-debate confidence. \"President Trump has survived every petty, partisan, pathetic attempt to remove him from office and is well positioned to do it one more time: on Election Day.\"Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Trump's eldest son and a campaign surrogate who watched the debate aboard Air Force One with his father, said that Mr. Bloomberg's performance amounted to a \"great night\" for his father.\"Bloomberg was the victim of a political homicide and was clearly not prepared for the onslaught coming his way at the debate,\" Donald Trump Jr. said in remarks relayed through a spokesman. \"If he can't handle Grandpa Joe or Pocahontas on the debate stage, what makes anyone think he can handle Trump?\"Before he left Las Vegas for Colorado, Mr. Trump treated an official White House event as something of a mini campaign rally. He traveled to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, where he delivered a commencement address for a program for former offenders -- but not before attacking the F.B.I. and Mrs. Clinton and commenting about the sentencing of Roger J. Stone Jr., a onetime political adviser.Mr. Trump, who approved a slate of pardons and sentence commutations this week, told the crowd that he wanted to see the sentencing process play out but believed that Mr. Stone would be exonerated. Mr. Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for obstructing a congressional inquiry in a bid to protect the president.\"At some point, I'll make a determination,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But Roger Stone and everybody has to be treated fairly. And this has not been a fair process.\"At the event, Mr. Trump also seemed to marvel that impeachment had happened at all.\"I didn't do anything wrong and they impeached me a few weeks ago,\" he told the group. \"I said: 'What happened? What did I do?' The good news, my numbers went through the roof.\"PhotographPresident Trump at a rally Thursday in Colorado where he took aim at a range of topics including windmills and the film \"Parasite.\" (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1070Show lessYou have requested \"on-the-fly\" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Bloomberg, a late arrival to the Democratic primary race, unnerved by his campaign spending and his suggestion he might spend $1 billion of his own fortune on opposing Mr. Trump, even if he does not emerge as the nominee.It has left the president and his campaign focused on two different candidates in the weeks before Democrats cast their first votes in Iowa -- one, a populist running with a grass-roots movement behind him, and the other, a liberal billionaire who could refashion the general election because of his bottomless bank account.Neither is the national front-runner, but Mr. Sanders is believed to have gained significant ground in Iowa, and both are on the minds of the president and his team.Most of Mr. Trump's advisers see his biggest looming threat as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has maintained a steady level of support despite an onslaught of attacks from the president and his team. But there is often a divide between how Mr. Trump and his aides view opponents.Over the past few weeks, aides to the president in a series of conversations have discussed how to keep the focus on Mr. Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist who favors a significant expansion of government health programs and who is currently at the top of some Iowa polls. They see attacking him as a way to excite his base and draw attention away from other Democrats.Such efforts tend to be haphazard and revolve around Mr. Trump's comments at rallies and on his Twitter feed, as does much of the messaging of his campaign. The president, his advisers say, has been in need of a clear target for months, and he believes he is actually hurting Mr. Sanders.Mr. Trump's advisers do not necessarily share that view. But they find utility in trying to elevate Mr. Sanders, and aides are discussing ways to keep attention on Mr. Sanders in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.\"Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party,\" Mr. Trump posted Sunday on Twitter, after a Des Moines Register poll showed Mr. Sanders leading in the state. \"So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!\"\"It means you're going to lose,\" Mr. Sanders tweeted in response.At a rally last week in Toledo, Ohio, the president singled out Mr. Sanders for his criticism of Mr. Trump's Jan. 3 drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani at Baghdad International Airport.\"Bernie is going up,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's surging. Crazy Bernie is surging.\"Most of the president's advisers see Mr. Sanders, if he were to become the nominee, as helping to solve Mr. Trump's problem with suburban voters in states like Virginia, where the 2018 midterm elections showed that moderate and independent voters have recoiled from the president's behavior, controversies or policy positions.But some have concerns that Mr. Sanders might be more durable in the Rust Belt states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, with high concentrations of white working-class voters that emerged as trouble spots for the president in the 2018 elections.The advisers say that in their voter research Mr. Sanders registers with his own supporters as authentic -- the same quality that Mr. Trump's base ascribed to the president in 2016. They view Mr. Sanders as a more difficult opponent than Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, but less of a challenge than Mr. Biden.And Mr. Trump's advisers are discussing rolling out policies to counter Mr. Sanders's populist appeal.In recent days, Mr. Trump's team has been interested in focusing attention on Mr. Sanders's comments after the strike that killed the General Suleimani, arguing that he will appear too dovish for the general electorate.\"We have no preference in potential opponents because President Trump will beat any one of them handily,\" Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a statement. \"However, over the last two weeks Bernie Sanders has proved himself to be dangerous -- not as an opponent but as a potential president -- by excusing and appeasing Iran's aggression and belligerence.\"\"Bernie Sanders would not protect American interests as president and his weakness is something that begs to be highlighted,\" he added.Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, pointed out that Mr. Trump ran as the candidate who \"would stop the endless wars\" and is now attacking the senator as weak. He added of Mr. Trump's efforts to tar Mr. Sanders: \"There's no 'there' there.\"As for Mr. Bloomberg, the president has made clear he is aware of the money Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, is pouring into the race -- especially into the attack ads hitting him in 118 media markets across the country. And this week he responded on Twitter to a TV spot focused on the top issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterms: health care.\"Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising,\" Mr. Trump tweeted, going on to misrepresent his role in the health care debate. \"I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual Mandate.\"Bloomberg aides noted that the ads highlight a core weakness for Mr. Trump, one that he seemed cognizant of defending himself over.\"My view from watching the president's tweets is that he is clearly seeing our ads, he's clearly concerned about their impact,\" said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. \"It's a massive television buy that is nationwide, attacking his biggest vulnerability and contrasting his failed record on health care.\"Mr. Bloomberg spent over $100 million in 2018 through his super PAC, involving himself in two dozen races across the country, and that has made him and his team confident they have identified his weaknesses.\"We amassed an enormous amount of data about what works in terms of identifying targeting the president's vulnerabilities,\" Mr. Wolfson said.But the Trump campaign has waved away concerns about Mr. Bloomberg's spending, arguing that it will only encourage Republican megadonors like Sheldon G. Adelson to spend more money for Mr. Trump.Despite Mr. Trump's own history of upending expectations of which candidates succeed, his aides insist they do not view Mr. Bloomberg as a serious contender for his party's nomination, and they believe that the power of his money is limited, noting that Mr. Bloomberg's aides would be legally prohibited from direct coordination with the Democratic nominee's campaign, unlike the national party committees.\"Hillary Clinton said she 'inherited nothing' from the D.N.C., which is as broke today as it was when she lost,\" said Mike Reed, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. \"Growing a $300 million data-driven field operation like we have at the R.N.C. takes years. Liberal billionaires can spend as much outside money as they want, but the eventual nominee cannot coordinate with anything they build.\"Campaign finance experts, however, said the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee were underestimating the effect of Mr. Bloomberg's cash infusion into the race and that Mr. Trump was right to be concerned.\"If Bloomberg does this, it will be unprecedented in American history,\" said Fred Wertheimer, the founder and president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit watchdog group. \"They will probably have more organizers than the R.N.C. will have. They will have loads of people in the battleground states, they'll have TV ads, they'll have digital ads.\"\"It will neutralize any financial advantages he thought he had,\" Mr. Wertheimer said, referring to the president, \"and if they're not worried, they're kidding themselves.\"Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, agreed that Mr. Bloomberg should not be dismissed.\"By any traditional measure, it's a pipe dream, but if we learned anything in 2016 it's that just because something has never happened before doesn't mean it can't happen now,\" he said. \"No one has ever talked about spending remotely as much money as he's talking about spending on this race.\"PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders on Sunday at a rally in Iowa City.

At a moment when first-term presidents are typically seeking a stable team to focus on their re-election, President Trump has embarked on a systematic attempt to sweep out officials perceived to be disloyal.The headquarters of the nation's intelligence apparatus roiled with the ouster of the acting director Joseph Maguire and his replacement by a sharp partisan amid a dispute over Russian election interference. The Justice Department remained on edge with whispers of further resignations, including perhaps even that of Attorney General William P. Barr, after the president's intervention in a case involving one of his friends. Witnesses from the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump have been summarily dismissed. Dozens of policy experts have been cleared out of the National Security Council staff as part of a restructuring that will mean fewer career professionals in range of the president. A deputy national security adviser dogged by innuendo about disloyalty was exiled to the Energy Department. A Trump appointee's nomination for a top Treasury Department post was pulled. The No. 3 official at the Defense Department was shown the door.And Johnny McEntee, a 29-year-old loyalist just installed to take over the Office of Presidential Personnel and reporting directly to Mr. Trump, has ordered a freeze on all political appointments across the government. He also convened a meeting to instruct departments to search for people not devoted to the president so they can be removed, according to people briefed about the session, and informed colleagues that he planned to tell cabinet secretaries that the White House would be choosing their deputies from now on.\"Trump appears to be launching the biggest assault on the nation's civil service system since the 1883 Pendleton Act ended the spoils system,\" said Paul C. Light, a New York University professor who has studied presidential personnel.But career professionals are not the only ones in the cross hairs. Also facing scrutiny are Republican political appointees considered insufficiently committed to the president or suspected of not aggressively advancing his agenda.Allies of the president say he should be free to make personnel changes, even if it amounts to shedding people who are not seen as loyal to Mr. Trump.\"It is not unusual at all that these types of assessments are done and thereafter changes are made,\" said Bradley A. Blakeman, a Republican strategist and former White House official under President George W. Bush.Nonetheless, the tumult and anxiety come at a time when the Trump administration confronts enormous challenges, including the coronavirus outbreak, Iranian and North Korean nuclear development and Russian determination to play a role again in America's next election. Democrats, for example, have expressed concerns about the administration's ability to respond if there were a severe coronavirus outbreak in the United States, noting that a global health security expert position on the National Security Council has been left vacant for almost two years.Mr. Trump has long been obsessed with loyalty, a view only exacerbated by his impeachment and the various investigations over the last three years that have convinced him that he is surrounded by a deep-state enemy within that is leaking, lying and sabotaging his presidency.He has also been frustrated by the decision-making process of government, aggravated at competing centers of power that have shaped the modern presidency but have, in his view, hindered his ability to enact policies.With a more loyal team in place, he hopes to make more progress on initiatives that have been slow-walked by institutional inertia or resistance like tougher rules on trade and immigration. But it could mean less dissent and less open debate with surviving officials fearing the loss of their jobs if they are seen as stepping out of line.From the beginning, his administration has been a turnstile of people who fall in and out of favor with the president. Including those with \"acting\" designations, he is on his third chief of staff, his fourth national security adviser, his fourth defense secretary, his fifth secretary of homeland security, his sixth deputy national security adviser and his seventh communications director.According to data compiled by Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, turnover among what she calls Mr. Trump's \"A team,\" meaning his senior staff, has hit 82 percent, more in three years than any of the previous five presidents saw in their first four years. Moreover, the Trump administration has been notable for a high level of serial turnover, with 38 percent of the top positions replaced more than once.\"Many key departments and White House entities have been hollowed out,\" Ms. Tenpas said. The president has thus been left with acting officials in many key areas. \"He seems completely unbothered,\" she said. \"He claims that actings give him flexibility, but fails to see that temporary leaders cannot advance his policies nearly as well as a Senate-confirmed appointee who has the stature and all the powers to do so.\"While some of the reliance on acting officials owes to a dysfunctional Senate confirmation process, Mr. Trump seems to prefer to keep senior advisers on edge as to whether they will keep their job. Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, a position that does not require Senate confirmation, is finishing his 14th month with an \"acting\" in front of his title for no reason that has ever been publicly articulated and he may be forced out without ever having been granted the full title.Mr. Mulvaney has shrugged it off, saying that anyone who works for Mr. Trump is by definition an acting official who could be dismissed at any time. But the president's refusal to bestow the full title strikes many as a form of ritual humiliation depriving him of stature, influence or job security.Just a few days ago, Mr. Mulvaney seemed to speak out in a way that caused many to wonder whether he may leave soon, voluntarily or not. During a session with the Oxford Union in England, he said that the United States was \"desperate\" for more immigrants and that Republicans seemed to stop caring about rising deficits when Mr. Trump took office. He added that \"I disagree with the president every single day\" but did not talk about it publicly.The newest power center at the White House is Mr. McEntee, a former assistant to the president who was fired by the previous chief of staff, John F. Kelly, but has been brought back as presidential personnel director. Mr. McEntee has made clear that his mission is to establish a more loyal team around the president. His meeting last Thursday with cabinet liaisons in which he called for rooting out disloyal officials was first reported by Axios.The ousters have extended beyond impeachment witnesses like Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman and the ambassador Gordon D. Sondland. John C. Rood, who was removed as under secretary of defense for policy, did not speak out publicly but had written internal emails skeptical of the freeze on security aid to Ukraine that was at the center of the impeachment inquiry.In National Security Council staff meetings, however, Mr. Rood was a constant voice of skepticism over the administration's troop reductions in Syria, its pending peace deal with the Taliban and other issues. With Mr. McEntee's arrival, that dissenting voice was no longer welcome, said a person familiar with the matter.Supporters of Jessie K. Liu, a Trump backer who served as the United States attorney in Washington, suspect her nomination for under secretary of Treasury was pulled because of dissatisfaction with her prosecution of Roger J. Stone Jr., the president's adviser convicted of obstruction and witness intimidation to protect Mr. Trump.Victoria Coates, a deputy national security adviser, was dispatched to the Energy Department despite denials that she was the anonymous official who wrote an Op-Ed and book critical of the administration.Mr. Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence who angered the president by allowing intelligence officials to tell House lawmakers that Russia was already intervening in the 2020 election on Mr. Trump's behalf, was replaced by Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and a vocal conservative with no background in intelligence.One of Mr. Grenell's first moves was to push out Andrew P. Hallman, the popular principal executive, who had been acting as the top deputy. Arriving with Mr. Grenell was Kashyap Patel, a senior National Security Council staff member and former key aide to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.Mr. Patel has been viewed warily by intelligence officers especially since news reports that his mandate was to clean house. Some top civil servants told colleagues they were contemplating quitting or feared being fired.But Mr. Grenell also began a charm offensive with senior officials and his initial meetings have put some at ease while making others think they should give the new boss a chance. It is also not clear who placed Mr. Patel in the office, with one official saying it was not Mr. Grenell's idea.Some allies of the administration cautioned against overanalyzing the developments in the intelligence office. Mr. Maguire was scheduled to leave next month anyway under a vacancies law, although administration officials had been looking for ways to extend him, and Mr. Grenell is only temporary while the president comes up with a nominee to send to the Senate. \"The O.D.N.I., I think, is less than meets the eye,\" said James Jay Carafano, a national security scholar at the Heritage Foundation, using the initials for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Even so, it has added to the wave of concern across the administration, even among Trump appointees. And that may be part of the point. Convinced that so many officials in government have been working against him, Mr. Trump does not mind if they are more than a little unsettled.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Julian E. Barnes and Noah Weiland from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump has long been obsessed with loyalty, a view only exacerbated by his impeachment and various investigations.

But they will not record it as the end of the struggle.President Trump's acquittal on Wednesday after a fiery three-week Senate impeachment trial provided him a moment of triumph, a sense of validation, a shot of momentum -- anything but the finality that he might want. The president who vowed to bring an end to endless wars overseas remains at the center of an endless war at home, one that now moves to the campaign trail and will not be resolved until November at the earliest.Rather than reaching out to bind the wounds, as President Bill Clinton did after his own Senate impeachment trial in 1999, Mr. Trump made clear minutes after the final roll call that he planned to go on the offensive. He opted to wait until Thursday to make a public appearance, on the advice of aides concerned about complicating the lives of Republicans who cast tough votes for him, but his Twitter feed and staff statements taunted his opponents and boasted of the \"Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax!\"Nor was the other side ready to surrender.Deflated by the nearly party-line vote, House Democrats took heart in winning over one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, and quickly signaled that they would continue their investigations into the president. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he was now \"likely\" to subpoena John R. Bolton, the president's former national security adviser, whose offer to testify in the Senate was rejected by the Republican majority.The prospect of continuing conflict over the president's effort to coerce Ukraine into helping him against his domestic rivals will presumably shape the national debate that is coming into focus as the Democrats begin voting to decide who will challenge Mr. Trump in the general election this fall.\"It's a referendum on whether we remain a constitutional republic,\" Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, said in an interview. \"We can easily survive four years of this,\" he added, but \"it's a very different landscape if he's re-elected after this. It illuminates what's at stake in the election.\"Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Mr. Trump's strongest Republican allies, agreed that rather than being settled by the vote on Wednesday, the battle now moved to the campaign trail. \"The only way this is going to end permanently is for the president to get re-elected,\" Mr. Graham said on the floor, \"and he will.\"For the president, that may be perfectly fine. The self-described counterpuncher appears eager to prosecute his case against his prosecutors. Even before the Senate vote, he tweeted or retweeted a barrage of messages attacking Speaker Nancy Pelosi for ripping up her copy of his State of the Union address (without mentioning that he had refused to shake her hand). After the verdict, he quickly turned his fire to Mr. Romney, posting an attack video mocking the senator.\"The vote today will open the floodgate for Trump to go after those who have wronged him in this process,\" said Jack O'Donnell, a former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., who has broken with Mr. Trump. \"The so-called hate list which he carries around will be expanded, and efforts to hurt those on the list will begin. He will have no fear, not that he ever had much when going after his enemies.\"Conciliation and acknowledging mistakes are not in his nature. Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family, pointed to the president's mentor, Roy Cohn. \"Never say you're wrong, always claim victory, get in people's face, repeat; if they accuse you of something, throw it back at them, double down, triple down,\" she said. \"He's taken Roy Cohn's mantra of total and complete belligerence and aggression not just to the next level but several levels past that.\"While Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said this week that she believed Mr. Trump had learned from the experiences that had prompted his impeachment and would recalibrate his actions in office accordingly, some who have studied him said that would not be in keeping with the president's history.\"I doubt he will be chastened by the impeachment or the trial,\" said Shirley Anne Warshaw, a presidential scholar at Gettysburg College. \"In fact, he will probably feel, unlike Susan Collins suggests, that he has open season now to do anything he wants because no one will rein him in for the next eight months.\"In decisively winning acquittal, Mr. Trump demonstrated a command of his Republican Party that would have been almost unthinkable when he came into office. While Mr. Romney generated much attention for his vote to convict, the fact that he was the only Republican to break with Mr. Trump was a powerful affirmation of the president's success at building brand loyalty in the party.By not backing down, not even an inch, he forced Republicans to choose between him and his critics, and they almost universally chose him.From Mr. Trump's point of view, the trial was simply the latest chapter in a campaign by his enemies to nullify his election that started before he even took office. He sees many of the developments of the last three years through that lens. The special counsel investigation into Russian election interference, the various congressional inquiries, the demands for his tax returns, the prosecution of so many of his former aides and associates all fit together in what he considers a scorched-earth effort to find something, anything, to take him down.But some of his allies said the president understands that the conflict is only part of the calculation over whether he will win a second term, which is why he made no mention of impeachment during his State of the Union address this week even though it almost certainly absorbed him for most of the other 22 and a half hours that day. Instead, he focused the speech on promoting his economic record, his military spending, his crackdown on immigration and his appointment of conservative judges.\"Some of what the president does is theater, which he revels in,\" said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump's. \"But he knows that the voters will really judge him on results, and that's why he's more bottom-line focused than people think.\"For Mr. Trump and his opponents, that bottom line is coming in the form of another up-or-down vote in 272 days. At that point, it will be clear whether it will provide the ending in the history book or just another page to turn.PhotographSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, at left, meeting with impeachment managers before the Senate vote on Wednesday.

Gen. Qassim Suleimani.Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have been involved in a he-said, she-said clash about whether he said during a private meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. Ms. Warren said he did, while Mr. Sanders has denied ever making such a statement.Mr. Trump, who in recent weeks has been seeking to elevate Mr. Sanders's Democratic presidential primary campaign, believing that he could beat him in November, weighed in on the side of the man over the woman.\"A woman can win for president,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That could happen, who knows.\"\"I don't believe Bernie said that, I really don't,\" he said. \"It's not the kind of a thing he'd say.\"It was not clear that validation from the president would help Mr. Sanders in an intraparty feud. But it was a classic Trump offer of an unsolicited two cents from the sidelines in the hopes of somehow influencing the debate.At Mr. Trump's rally, in a state he won in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes, he also mocked Democrats for questioning whether there was any imminent threat from Iran, hoping to capitalize politically on the killing of General Suleimani, which campaign aides said had delivered him a small bump in their polling.\"Great percentages of people don't have legs or arms because of this son of a bitch,\" Mr. Trump told a raucous crowd of supporters, who had lined up on the gray, snow-covered streets of Milwaukee for hours to see him speak.He said that it \"doesn't matter\" to Democrats that General Suleimani had killed \"hundreds of thousands of people,\" and that \"they'll start a new investigation\" over whether there was really any imminent threat.Mr. Trump, who had previously claimed that four American embassies were under threat -- a charge his own administration could not back -- also appeared on Tuesday evening to imply that the number could have been higher, but that the threat was vaguer.\"If I didn't kill him, and let's say we lost three, four, five embassies or bases,\" he said, trailing off.His breezy dismissal of the entire discussion of an imminent threat came after the administration had insisted for more than 10 days that General Suleimani, Iran's most important military official, was planning myriad \"imminent\" attacks.The president said that \"Democrats are outraged that we killed this terrorist monster,\" calling General Suleimani the \"king of roadside bombs\" and blaming President Barack Obama for not taking him out. \"He should have been killed 20 years ago,\" Mr. Trump said.It was the president's first campaign rally in Wisconsin since April, and its early billing on his 2020 rally calendar signaled the importance that both parties plan to place on a state where Mr. Trump's victory four years ago blindsided Hillary Clinton's campaign.\"I shouldn't even be here tonight,\" Mr. Trump said, \"but I love the people of Wisconsin.\"Eager to overcome the narrative that Mrs. Clinton lost the 2016 election, in part, because of her infamous decision to not visit the state even once, Democrats have selected Milwaukee as the city to host their nominating convention in July. And Priorities USA, one of the leading Democratic super PACs, has been outspending the Trump campaign on digital ads in the state since last July.Mr. Trump came to Wisconsin to promote his campaign theme of \"Promises made, Promises kept.\" But in reality, dairy farmers in the state have been struggling since he took office, with some farms even shutting down. Democrats attribute the loss of dairy farms and related jobs to Mr. Trump threatening a trade war with China.The president, however, put forth his trade policies as reasons to support him.\"What we've done with China, what we've done with the U.S.M.C.A., what we've done with Japan,\" he said. \"You've got to love Trump. You've got to love Trump.\"Meantime, Democrats signaled that they would invest heavily to win back the state.\"Wisconsin is going to be one of the states that decides this election, and we're investing in the state accordingly,\" said Cassidy Geoghegan, the Wisconsin outreach director for Priorities USA. She said that health care costs in the state were on the rise and that \"farmers are having to sell their cows and close down their operations,\" while wages were not keeping up.During the rally -- which started before the Democrats took the stage for their debate in Des Moines -- Mr. Trump also singled out Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., mocking him for not knowing what state he was campaigning in. \"When you do that, you can't really recover,\" the president. \"You can be Winston Churchill. But you get killed. He does that every time.\"In reality, Mr. Trump has also suffered his share of confusion about his speaking locations or where tragedies have occurred under his watch. In a somber, televised speech in August after two mass shootings, for instance, Mr. Trump blessed \"the memory of those who perished in Toledo,\" referring to a city more than 100 miles away from Dayton, the scene of an Ohio massacre.Mr. Trump's rally was the centerpiece of a two-day push in Wisconsin, with top Trump aides and family members making stops at smaller venues around the state.Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior adviser, flew commercial with Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, to Milwaukee from Washington on Tuesday morning to lead a discussion about prisoner re-entry programs.Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump, the president's second eldest son, visited Rib Mountain on Monday to speak to voters. And Vice President Mike Pence made an unannounced visit to a Culver's restaurant in Milwaukee to talk to voters in the kind of small, intimate venue that Mr. Trump does not often frequent himself.For his part, Mr. Trump delivered what has become his standard, rambling stump speech, which combines inflated boasts about his record, rosy memories about his 2016 victory and grievances about the way he has been treated by Democrats. His remarks, delivered in an uncharacteristically hoarse voice, were punctuated by individual protesters in a sea of enthusiastic supporters clad in red Trump campaign T-shirts and hats.On the eve of the official beginning to the formal start of the Senate impeachment trial against him, Mr. Trump claimed, once again, that Democrats were trying to impeach him because of his success with the economy and rebuilding the military.He targeted Speaker Nancy Pelosi, noting that \"her district is filthy dirty,\" filled with syringes and cautioned her to spend more time at home.But he said he was confident about his chances. Calling the 2016 election the most important election in history, he noted that 2020 \"maybe, in its own way, will be just as important.\"PhotographPresident Trump's rally on Tuesday was part of a campaign push this week in Wisconsin, a state that helped deliver his 2016 victory.

Schiff of California, the lead House prosecutor, took the lectern in the chamber as senators sat silently preparing to weigh Mr. Trump's fate. Speaking in an even, measured manner, he accused the president of a corrupt scheme to pressure Ukraine for help \"to cheat\" in the 2020 presidential election.Invoking the nation's founders and their fears that a self-interested leader might subvert democracy for his own personal gain, Mr. Schiff argued that the president's conduct was precisely what the framers of the Constitution had in mind when they devised the remedy of impeachment, one he said was \"as powerful as the evil it was meant to combat.\"\"If not remedied by his conviction in the Senate, and removal from office, President Trump's abuse of his office and obstruction of Congress will permanently alter the balance of power among the branches of government,\" Mr. Schiff said in his opening remarks. \"The president has shown that he believes that he's above the law and scornful of constraint.\"The Senate proceeding, the third impeachment trial of a president in the nation's history, was fraught with partisan rancor and political consequence both for Mr. Trump and for the two parties grappling over his future.In a series of speeches, Mr. Schiff and the six other impeachment managers asserted that the president pressured Ukraine to announce an investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden, while withholding as leverage nearly $400 million in security aid for Kyiv and a White House meeting for its president. When he was caught, they said, Mr. Trump ordered a cover-up, blocking witnesses and denying Congress the evidence that could corroborate his scheme.\"President Trump withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to a strategic partner at war with Russia to secure foreign help with his re-election,\" Mr. Schiff declared. \"In other words, to cheat.\"The Democrats will continue to lay out their now-familiar case on Thursday, although there is little doubt about the outcome of the trial. It is all but certain to end in Mr. Trump's acquittal in the Senate, where it would take 67 votes to convict and remove him. But the contours of the trial remained up in the air, as Republicans and Democrats continued to feud over whether to consider additional evidence, including witnesses the president has forbade from cooperating with the inquiry.Mr. Trump -- impatient for his legal team to have a chance to mount a vigorous defense of his behavior -- was on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, hurling insults at the impeachment managers and telling reporters he would like to personally attend the Senate trial in order to \"sit right in the front row and stare into their corrupt faces.\"At a news conference in Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic Forum, Mr. Trump said that John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, could not be allowed to testify because he \"knows my thoughts on certain people and other governments, war and peace and different things -- that's a national security problem.\"Mr. Schiff insisted in his opening arguments that fairness demanded hearing from Mr. Bolton, who has pledged to testify if the Senate subpoenas him, and other White House officials. Democrats angrily rejected the suggestion that they might agree to call Hunter Biden in exchange for Mr. Bolton's appearance.\"This isn't like some fantasy football trade,\" Mr. Schiff said before the trial commenced Wednesday. \"Trials aren't trades for witnesses.\"Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, told reporters the idea was \"off the table.\"Campaigning in Iowa, Joseph Biden was adamant in rejecting any testimony trade-off. \"This is a constitutional issue,\" he said. \"We're not going to turn it into a farce, into some kind of political theater.\"A set of closed-door negotiations among senators appears likely to soon intensify as Democrats plot their strategy for winning a vote on witnesses, which would require the votes of a handful of centrist Republican senators who have signaled they are open to the idea. Votes on the matter are likely next week, after the House managers and White House lawyers complete their arguments and senators have had a chance to submit questions about the case.On the first day of oral arguments, Mr. Schiff opened with a plea for patience, telling senators that \"we have some very long days yet to come.\" But senators already seemed restless; many passed notes to each other, and as the hours wore on, a handful of seats were frequently empty as lawmakers from both parties slipped out of the chamber for brief respites from the weighty -- and often very tedious -- arguments.A protester in the Senate gallery briefly interrupted arguments from Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, shouting \"Schumer is the devil\" and yelling that Democrats support abortion before being dragged out by Capitol Hill police officers.On the floor, the managers sought to place Mr. Trump's Ukraine pressure campaign in the context of what they called a broader impulse by the president to cede America's foreign policy to Russia. It was no coincidence, Mr. Schiff argued, that Mr. Trump had asked the president of Ukraine for investigations into his rivals just one day after Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 election, issued his report.\"President Trump, believing he had escaped accountability for Russia meddling in the first election, and welcoming of it, asked the Ukrainian president to help him undermine the special counsel's conclusion and help him smear a political opponent,\" Mr. Schiff said.For now, the president's legal team must sit silently in the chamber as the president's House accusers have exclusive access to the microphone. Under the rules of the trial adopted on Tuesday, the House managers have 24 hours over three days to present their case, leaving White House lawyers to take in their searingly argued case about Mr. Trump's actions, with no opportunity for immediate rebuttal.The president vented his spleen about the process on Twitter, firing off so many posts that he set a record for any single day in his presidency.As of 11:30 p.m., Mr. Trump had posted or reposted 142 messages on Twitter, surpassing the previous record of 123 set in December. Most were retweets of messages from allies and supporters assailing Mr. Schiff and others prosecuting the case.During a dinner break on Wednesday, the president's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow raced to face reporters, vowing to eventually respond \"to what the House managers have put forward, and we are going to make an affirmative case defending the president.\"The tables will turn this week, most likely on Saturday, when the defense team will be given its own 24 hours of uninterrupted time to play to the cameras from the Senate floor, with House Democrats sidelined. The defense of the president could continue into early next week after a break on Sunday.The oral arguments on Wednesday began only hours after the conclusion of a lengthy fight over witnesses and documents that stretched into the wee hours of the day and cleaved the Senate along party lines. It was dominated by bitter exchanges between the Democratic House managers and the president's legal defense team that grew so personal and hostile after midnight that they drew a reprimand from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial.Several senators said they were particularly piqued by the managers' repeated insistence -- put most bluntly by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who at one point accused Republican senators of \"treacherous\" behavior -- that the Senate was abetting a cover-up of Mr. Trump's misconduct and preparing to hold a sham trial by rejecting Democrats' demands for witnesses and documents.\"What Chairman Nadler said and how he conducted himself was outrageous and an insult to the Senate,\" said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. \"We don't need to continue the clown circus that started over in the House.\"The tenor of the House Democrats' presentation on Tuesday also bothered some Democratic senators, who took issue with what they characterized as an overly accusatory tone by the impeachment managers. Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, told reporters that Mr. Nadler \"could have chosen better words.\"Even as the House managers began laying out their case, newly released emails revealed additional evidence of friction between the Defense Department and the White House over a freeze sought by the president on military assistance to Ukraine. The emails, released just before midnight on Tuesday as a result of a Freedom of Information lawsuit, underscored the confusion and surprise among lawmakers, including some prominent Republicans, who learned that the military assistance to Ukraine had been held up.Arguing for the prosecution, Mr. Schiff delved deeply into the details of the Ukraine pressure campaign, citing specific dates and meetings. But he also sought to pull back the lens, telling senators that they must act to remove Mr. Trump or \"we will write the history of our decline with our own hand.\"Mr. Nadler described the smear campaign against Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine. Representative Jason Crow of Colorado discussed the national security implications of withholding security aid from Ukraine. And Representative Val B. Demings of Florida told senators about the effort to withhold a White House meeting that Ukraine wanted until the country announced investigations into the Bidens.At the end of the session, Chief Justice Roberts announced that senators would be given access to a one-page classified document shared by the House that contains supplemental testimony from Jennifer Williams, a national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence.Mr. Schiff has repeatedly asked for the supplement -- which is said to pertain to a September phone call between Mr. Pence and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine -- to be declassified, without success. A Democratic official working on the case said Wednesday night that the document would provide senators \"further corroborative evidence\" related to the charges against Mr. Trump.The president had at one point embraced the idea of pushing for a quick dismissal of the case against him, but his lawyers chose not to take that opportunity on Wednesday. Republican leaders discouraged the defense team from seeking a vote this week that would almost certainly have failed, dividing Republicans and dealing Mr. Trump an early symbolic defeat.A motion to dismiss the case could still be offered later in the trial.Reporting was contributed by Nicholas Fandos, Emily Cochrane, Catie Edmondson and Peter Baker from Washington, and Katie Glueck from Osage, Iowa.PhotographRepresentative Adam B.

Biden Jr.WASHINGTON -- House Democrats sought on Thursday to pre-emptively dismantle President Trump's core defenses in his impeachment trial, invoking his own words to argue that his pressure campaign on Ukraine was an abuse of power that warranted his removal.On the second day of arguments in the third presidential impeachment trial in American history, Democrats sought to make the case that Mr. Trump's actions were an affront to the Constitution. And they worked to disprove his lawyers' claims that he was acting only in the nation's interests when he sought to enlist Ukraine to investigate political rivals.In doing so, they took a calculated risk in talking at length about Mr. Trump's targets -- former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden -- and underscored the political backdrop of a trial that is unfolding only 10 months before the election and is likely to reverberate long after the verdict.\"You know you can't trust this president to do what's right for this country -- you can trust he will do what's right for Donald Trump,\" said Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, said in an impassioned appeal as the clock ticked past 10 p.m. \"This is why if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Right matters and the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.\"The team of seven Democratic impeachment managers repeatedly attacked the idea that when the president withheld military aid from Ukraine and sought to secure a promise to investigate Joseph Biden, he was merely making a foreign policy decision to root out corruption in Ukraine.Mr. Trump has consistently suggested, without any evidence, that Mr. Biden pushed to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company with a long history of corruption that employed Hunter Biden on its board. Representative Sylvia R. Garcia, Democrat of Texas, spent nearly an hour debunking the claim, and said that, in fact, the opposite was true.The prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was \"widely perceived as corrupt,\" she said, and Mr. Biden was acting in accordance with official American policy, as well as the policy of the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations in calling for his removal.Moreover, Mr. Shokin had already let the Burisma investigation \"go dormant,\" Ms. Garcia said, so his ouster \"would only increase the chance that Burisma would be investigated for possible corruption.\" She asserted that neither the elder Mr. Biden nor his son had done anything wrong, and that American officials -- and Mr. Trump -- knew it.\"Every single witness who was asked about the allegations again said that Biden had nothing to do with it and it was false; they testified that he acted properly,\" Ms. Garcia said, adding, \"There is simply no evidence, nothing, nada in the record to support this baseless allegation.\"It was, in effect, a defense of one of the Democrats' leading 2020 presidential candidates and a potential challenger to the president. Mr. Schiff later volunteered that neither he nor his colleagues had a position on the Democratic presidential primary.Mr. Schiff also brought Mr. Trump into the chamber -- at least on video -- to use the president's own words against him, with a clip in which the president called both Bidens \"corrupt\" and called for Ukraine to start a \"major investigation\" into them.\"The president has confirmed what he wanted in his own words,\" Mr. Schiff said. \"He has made it clear he didn't care about corruption, he cared only about himself. Now it is up to us to do something about it, to make sure that a president, that this president, cannot pursue an objective that places himself above our country.\"But in focusing on the Bidens, Democrats took a strategic risk. Some Republicans have already threatened to call the Bidens as witnesses, even suggesting that they would insist on hearing from them as a condition of agreeing to subpoena John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser.Democrats have refused to consider the idea, and Mr. Biden has said he would not take part in any such swap. And on Thursday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he would not \"give in to that pressure\" from some of his colleagues to do so.But Mr. Trump's legal team said the Bidens were now fair game in the trial.\"They have opened the door,\" said Jay Sekulow. \"It's now relevant.\"Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said the Democrats' arguments had made testimony from the Bidens vital.\"If we're going to call witnesses,\" he said, \"it's now clear we absolutely must call Hunter Biden, and we probably need to call Joe Biden.\"Mr. Trump seemed to be paying attention. At a Republican National Committee event on Thursday evening at the president's club in Doral, Fla., he told 400 people that the proceedings were \"impeachment lite\" compared with the trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999 and the case against President Richard M. Nixon in the 1970s.In laying out their case against Mr. Trump, the Democrats focused tightly on the first of two charges against him: that he abused his power by trying to compel a foreign power to help him win re-election in 2020 and withheld two official acts -- the provision of $391 million in military aid and a White House meeting with Ukraine's president -- in an effort to advance his illicit scheme.\"President Trump exploited our ally, Ukraine, for his own political benefit to the detriment of American national security,\" said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York. \"Is that conduct impeachable? The answer is categorically yes. The Senate must hold this president accountable for his abuse of power crimes against our Constitution.\"Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said: \"Impeachment is not punishment for a crime. Impeachment exists to address threats to the political system.\"\"Impeachment is the Constitution's final answer to a president who mistakes himself for a king,\" he added.Democrats expect to wrap up their case on Friday with presentations aimed at proving the second charge: that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by withholding documents and witnesses and otherwise working to conceal his behavior. On Saturday, Mr. Trump's defense team is expected to lay out its case.On Thursday, Mr. Nadler drew on quotes from Alexander Hamilton; from George Washington's farewell address; and from a 1792 letter to Thomas Jefferson from John Adams that warned of \"foreign intrigue and influence\" in arguing that Mr. Trump warranted impeachment and removal from office -- regardless of whether he committed a crime.\"No president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections,\" Mr. Nadler said, adding, \"It puts even President Nixon to shame.\"Mr. Nadler also turned to Trump allies -- including Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard Law professor who is assisting in the president's defense, and Mr. Graham -- to make his case, using video clips of their comments from the Clinton impeachment trial to undercut Mr. Trump's defense.In one clip, Mr. Graham, an impeachment manager during the Clinton trial, explained why a \"high crime\" -- one of the criteria the Constitution sets forth for the impeachment and removal of a president -- does not necessarily require breaking a law.\"When you start using your office and you're acting in a way that hurts people, you've committed a high crime,\" Mr. Graham said.Even before Thursday's session got underway, it was clear that Mr. Schiff, Mr. Nadler and the other managers had not changed the minds of many Republicans. Senate Democrats were privately expressing concern that they may not get the four Republican votes they would need to bring witnesses and documents into the trial.If they do not, the case could be over by the end of next week. Publicly, though, Democrats were putting on a good face.\"I am more hopeful than ever that four conscientious, brave Republicans will come forward and tell Mitch McConnell you can't shut this down without witnesses, you can't shut this down without documents,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, referring to his Republican counterpart.The rules of the trial require senators to \"keep silent, on pain of imprisonment,\" and after two lengthy days of first voting on motions on Tuesday and hearing oral arguments on Wednesday, Republicans were growing weary.Some complained that Democrats were simply reciting the same facts time and time again, more for the television viewing audience than for the audience in the chamber. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, handed out fidget spinner toys to his colleagues, ostensibly to ease the boredom -- and to deliver a not-too-subtle dig at Democrats.\"They spent a lot of time, they're well prepared -- I just don't think they have much to work with,\" said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. \"They've got about a one-hour presentation that they gave six hours on Tuesday and eight hours yesterday.\"But Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said the Democrats had good reason to be repetitive: Many senators -- not to mention the public -- did not pay close attention to the House inquiry. One Republican, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, told reporters as much on Wednesday.\"Senators didn't know the case,\" he said. \"They really didn't. We didn't stay glued to the television. We haven't read the transcripts.\"Reporting was contributed by Michael D.

Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a top Iranian commander. They then direct voters to the \"Official Trump Military Survey.\"On Thursday, President Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful Iranian military commander. By Monday, the Trump campaign was running ads on Facebook touting the general's death.\"Thanks to the swift actions of our commander in chief, Iranian General Qassem Soleimani is no longer a threat to the United States, or to the world,\" several of the Trump ads read, using an alternate spelling of the Iranian general's name. Some featured pictures of a beaming Mr. Trump from one of his campaign rallies; others showed a stoic, finger-waving president, also in front of supporters.The ads asked voters to take the \"Official Trump Military Survey,\" directing users to Mr. Trump's re-election campaign website.All told, the Trump campaign has run nearly 800 distinct Facebook ads about the killing of General Suleimani, according to Acronym, a progressive digital strategy group. Political campaigns often run many digital ads with similar versions of a message, and Mr. Trump's campaign is among the most prolific advertisers on Facebook, often running hundreds of ads with subtle differences.It is not yet known how much the campaign has spent on the ads because Facebook's public ad database does not immediately report such figures. But Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm, said the Trump campaign had spent at least $8,000 on the ads so far.The advertising campaign is running as tensions between the United States and Iran ramp up. Iran's supreme leader is vowing retribution against the United States, the Pentagon is at odds with Mr. Trump over threatening Iranian cultural sites, and some Democrats have suggested that the president may have ordered the strike to take attention away from the looming Senate impeachment trial.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.These types of ads, known as acquisition ads, are intended to help campaigns gather more information about internet users with the goal of turning them into online donors.Most of the Trump campaign's Suleimani ads work the same way. First, potential voters are shown the ad. Clicking on it brings them to a brief survey on the Trump campaign's website, which asks questions like, \"Do you believe America has the greatest military in the world?\" The survey also asks for a name, email address and phone number, which the campaign can then add to its database of potential donors.Users who submit the survey are also prompted to donate right away, with a message that says, \"President Trump is keeping AMERICA SAFE! Now it's time to step up and stand behind him.\" Donation buttons ranging from $42 to $2,800 appear below the text.Though online surveys are an exceptionally common form of political advertising and fund-raising, the use of General Suleimani's death in the advertisements is likely to draw criticism from Democrats.Other presidents have run advertisements during re-election campaigns that have tried to capitalize on major military events -- and have also been accused of trying to politicize them.During President Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, his team produced a digital video about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The video praised Mr. Obama's decision making and asked, \"Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?\"Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was vice president at the time, said that Mr. Obama's re-election slogan should be, \"Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive.\"And last year, Mr. Trump ran hundreds of Facebook ads about the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State. Those ads began running a day after the news of his killing was made public.\"President Trump has brought the #1 terrorist leader to justice. He is KEEPING AMERICA SAFE,\" one ad said. Others cited \"the fierce leadership of our commander in chief.\"They also directed users to surveys on the campaign website.PhotographPresident Trump rallied supporters in Miami on Friday, one day after ordering the strike that killed an Iranian commander.

They also vividly illustrated how the proceeding is almost certain to rekindle feuding over the 2016 election that has barely subsided during Mr. Trump's tenure, and reverberate -- whether he is convicted or acquitted -- in an even more brutal electoral fight in November.In a 46-page trial memorandum, and additional 60-page statement of facts, the House impeachment managers asserted that beginning in the spring, Mr. Trump undertook a corrupt campaign to enlist a foreign government to help him win the 2020 election. He did so, the Democrats argued, by pressuring Ukraine to publicly announce investigations of his political rivals, withholding as leverage vital military aid and a White House meeting for the country's president.The president then sought to conceal those actions from Congress, they said, posing \"a serious danger to our constitutional checks and balances\" by ordering administration officials not to testify or turn over documents requested by a House impeachment inquiry.\"President Trump's conduct is the framers' worst nightmare,\" wrote the seven Democratic managers, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California.In a six-page filing formally responding to the House impeachment charges submitted shortly after and filled with partisan barbs against House Democrats, Mr. Trump's lawyers denounced the case as constitutionally and legally invalid, and driven purely by a desire to hurt Mr. Trump in the 2020 election.\"The articles of impeachment submitted by House Democrats are a dangerous attack on the right of the American people to freely choose their president,\" they said in the response, which was Mr. Trump's first legal submission in the impeachment proceeding, ahead of a fuller brief that is due on Monday. \"This is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election, now just months away.\"The president's lawyers did not deny any of the core facts underlying Democrats' charges, conceding what considerable evidence and testimony in the House has shown: that he withheld $391 million in aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine and asked the country's president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden.But they said Mr. Trump broke no laws and was acting entirely appropriately and within his powers when he did so, echoing his repeated protestations of his own innocence. They argued that he was not seeking political advantage, but working to root out corruption in Ukraine.\"President Trump categorically and unequivocally denies each and every allegation in both articles of impeachment,\" wrote Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, and Jay Sekulow, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer.The managers' filing repeated many of the same arguments they laid out last fall in a report on the findings of their two-month impeachment inquiry. But it also indicated that they intended to make use of information that has come to light since the House's impeachment vote in December.They cited new documentary records handed over by Lev Parnas, an associate of the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, about the pressure campaign on Ukraine, and a Government Accountability Office report released this week that found that Mr. Trump violated the law when he withheld the military aid.And though the House ultimately declined to bring charges based on the special counsel's Russia investigation, Saturday's filing indicates the managers are also poised to reprise its findings as they argue that Mr. Trump's behavior toward Ukraine fits a pattern that poses a continuing threat to American elections. They argued that, just as Mr. Trump welcomed interference on his behalf from Russia in the 2016 election and then sought to thwart a federal investigation into the matter, he solicited Ukrainian assistance in the 2020 contest and then obstructed Congress's ability to investigate.The nation's founders, the House Democrats said in their brief, \"designed impeachment as the remedy for such misconduct because a president who manipulates U.S. elections to his advantage can avoid being held accountable by the voters through those same elections.\"They called Mr. Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to discredit his political adversaries \"part of an ongoing pattern of misconduct for which the president is unrepentant.\"The president, who spent Saturday at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla., has made no secret of his disdain for the House's charges and its inquiry. He has repeatedly professed his total innocence in general terms, and specifically insisted that a July phone call in which he pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and other Democrats was \"perfect.\"But when invited to take part in the proceedings or mount a defense before the House Judiciary Committee, he refused. The closest the president's lawyers had come to weighing in on the case was an eight-page letter to House Democrats in October in which they unequivocally refused to furnish any documents or allow any witnesses to testify.Like that letter, Mr. Trump's answer to the Senate on Saturday was heavy with political messaging even as it asserted broad constitutional principles and general legal arguments to proclaim the president's innocence.In a statement later in the evening, the House managers criticized the claim by the president's legal team that the pressure on Ukraine was just Mr. Trump's way of fighting corruption.\"It is not,\" the Democratic lawmakers wrote. \"Rather it is corruption itself, naked, unapologetic and insidious.\"The defense filing was far shorter than the House managers' memorandum, but White House lawyers have until noon on Monday to produce a more comprehensive legal brief laying out the case they will make on the floor of the Senate.The House can then submit a written rebuttal by Tuesday. If all goes according to plan, the managers will begin live presentations in the Senate on Wednesday, and under an expedited schedule being contemplated by Senate Republicans, the president's team could begin its presentation on Friday.The defense filing on Saturday argued that Mr. Trump \"has not in any way abused the powers of the presidency,\" and that the July 25 call between Mr. Trump and the president of Ukraine was \"perfectly legal, entirely appropriate, and taken in furtherance of our national interest.\"The arguments by Mr. Trump's lawyers tracked closely with those presented throughout the House inquiry by Republicans in that chamber, like Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who did not dispute what had occurred so much as the idea that the president had been acting on some corrupt scheme.The document appeared intended to appeal to Mr. Trump's sensibilities. It accused Mr. Schiff of \"creating a fraudulent version\" of the July 25 call when he jokingly offered a hypothetical conversation during a congressional hearing, something that Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked Mr. Schiff for doing.As they have said for weeks, the president's lawyers asserted that the articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump are \"invalid on their face\" because they do not accuse the president of breaking any law.But the Democrats argued in their memorandum that impeachable actions \"need not be indictable offenses,\" a theory that has been espoused by many legal scholars. The framers of the Constitution, they argued, intended the remedy for \"acts committed by public officials that inflict severe harm on the constitutional order.\"The president's legal team also rejected the charge that Mr. Trump is guilty of obstruction of Congress. They argued that Mr. Trump's attempts to prevent witnesses from testifying in what the president has called a \"sham\" impeachment inquiry is a legitimate exercise of executive privilege that is essential to guard the authority and prerogatives of the presidency.The House concluded that Mr. Trump's claims of \"absolute immunity\" or other privileges on behalf of 12 officials and his decision to block the delivery of documents amounted to flagrant obstruction. The president's lawyers made clear that they disagreed, saying that \"asserting valid constitutional privileges and immunities cannot be an impeachable offense.\"The president's lawyers also accused Congress of denying Mr. Trump due process during the impeachment proceedings, including \"the right to have counsel present, the right to cross-examine witnesses and the right to present evidence.\"While the president's lawyers were not allowed to attend closed-door depositions of some witnesses, Republican allies of the president attended every interview and asked questions, according to transcripts of the sessions.The president rejected Democratic offers to present evidence, question witnesses or otherwise mount a defense during hearings before the House Judiciary Committee.Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Sekulow will lead the president's defense at trial. The White House announced Friday that the team would also include Ken Starr, the former independent counsel whose investigation of President Bill Clinton led to his impeachment, Robert W. Ray, who succeeded Mr. Starr, and Alan Dershowitz, a celebrity defense lawyer.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.PhotographPresident Trump traveled to Florida for the weekend ahead of his Senate trial, which opens Tuesday.

A former national security adviser confirms that the president, despite his denials, conditioned security aid to a war-torn ally on its cooperation against his domestic rivals, the issue at the heart of his ongoing impeachment trial.At first glance, John R. Bolton's account of President Trump's private remarks sounded like an echo of the so-called smoking gun tape that proved President Richard M. Nixon really had orchestrated the Watergate cover-up and ultimately forced him from office. By the end of Monday, the revelation appeared to make it more likely that the Senate will agree to hear witnesses at the trial.But this is Mr. Trump's era and Mr. Trump's Washington, and the old rules do not always apply anymore. The reality show star who was elected president even after he was captured on an \"Access Hollywood\" tape boasting about sexual assault has gone on to survive one politically charged furor after another during his three years in the White House, proving more durable than any national politician in modern American history.So will this be a Watergate-style turning point or just one more disclosure that his critics consider validation without changing other minds? Will it be another smoking gun or another \"Access Hollywood\"?The news of Mr. Bolton's account in an unpublished book, first reported by The New York Times, could hardly have come at a worse time for Mr. Trump, just as his lawyers opened his defense on the Senate floor and days before the senators will vote on witnesses like Mr. Bolton.Even as stunned and, in some cases, irritated Republican senators scrambled to figure out what to do, the president's lawyers pointedly ignored Mr. Bolton's book when they addressed the Senate on Monday, repeating their claim that Mr. Trump suspended $391 million in security aid to Ukraine to tackle corruption and force more European support for the former Soviet republic, not to leverage foreign help incriminating his Democratic rivals.Directly contradicting Mr. Bolton's account, Michael Purpura, a deputy White House counsel, asserted that \"anyone who spoke with the president said that the president made clear that there was no linkage between security assistance and investigations.\"By the end of the day, Alan M. Dershowitz, another lawyer for Mr. Trump, acknowledged the new account but told senators that \"nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense.\"Privately, though, the president's legal team braced for the possibility that the Senate would vote to call witnesses as they tried to defuse anger among Republican senators who felt blindsided. The White House knew what Mr. Bolton had to say at least as far back as Dec. 30, when he sent the manuscript to the National Security Council for standard pre-publication review, and yet the president's lawyers continued to promote a completely opposite version of events to the senators.In his book, Mr. Bolton writes that Mr. Trump told him in August that he wanted to continue freezing congressionally approved security assistance to Ukraine until its government helped with investigations into Democrats including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden -- exactly what Mr. Trump is on trial for.Mr. Trump and his defenders sought to undercut Mr. Bolton by dismissing him as a disgruntled former employee seeking to take revenge and sell books. Mr. Bolton abruptly left the White House in September after months of tension with the president over his policies toward North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and Ukraine; the president insisted that he fired him, while Mr. Bolton insisted he resigned.Starting early Monday morning and continuing into the day, Mr. Trump fired off messages on Twitter rebutting his former adviser's account and attacking him as untrustworthy.\"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,\" the president wrote. \"In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.\"He also reposted messages from supporters assailing Mr. Bolton and comparing him to others the president viewed as disloyal like James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired in 2017. \"Just like James Comey, John Bolton is trying to get rich off a lie- and leak-fueled campaign to overturn the 2016 election results,\" read one of the messages the president retweeted.But Mr. Bolton is a hard witness for Mr. Trump to simply brush off. He is no liberal Democrat or deep-state bureaucrat, nor is he even a Never Trump Republican, but a conservative hawk with years of credibility among Republicans and a strong following from his days as ambassador to the United Nations and Fox News commentator. And rebutting his account is a president with a history of making thousands of false and misleading statements documented by fact checkers.Mr. Bolton's account on its face seems to eviscerate a central part of the defense that the White House began presenting Saturday on the Senate floor. The president's lawyers hammered House Democrats for relying on secondhand testimony and argued that no witness had come forward to say Mr. Trump had explicitly linked the aid to the investigations.In their trial brief, the president's lawyers wrote: \"Not a single witness with actual knowledge ever testified that the president suggested any connection between announcing investigations and security assistance. Assumptions, presumptions and speculation based on hearsay are all that House Democrats can rely on to spin their tale of a quid pro quo.\"The House managers prosecuting Mr. Trump said that underestimated the strength of their evidence, but either way, Mr. Bolton's recollection is clearly a firsthand account, not a presumption -- which at least some in the White House knew at the time the brief was filed and the presentation was made on the Senate floor over the weekend.Mr. Bolton has been one of the most intriguing figures in the Ukraine matter for weeks, ever since other former officials testified that he opposed the pressure campaign, calling it a \"drug deal\" he wanted no part of and warning that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer organizing the pressure, was a \"hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up.\" Mr. Bolton told aides to report the pressure campaign to a White House lawyer.Mr. Bolton has remained publicly silent other than to deny leaking his book and blaming its disclosure on the White House. House Democrats requested his testimony during their hearings last month, but they ultimately did not subpoena him, reasoning that a court fight would only prolong the investigative process for months.Once the House impeached Mr. Trump and the case reached the Senate, Mr. Bolton announced that he would testify if subpoenaed. But Senate Republicans voted against subpoenaing him at the start of the trial, putting off a final decision until after arguments are complete, which could come later this week.Another witness sought by the House managers, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, has already publicly confirmed to reporters that Mr. Trump suspended the security aid in part to get Ukraine to investigate a conspiracy theory involving Democrats during the 2016 election campaign, although he later issued a statement retracting his comment.His lawyer issued another statement on Monday denying that Mr. Mulvaney ever talked with Mr. Trump or anyone else about a link between aid and investigations, even though the acting chief of staff previously said the exact opposite on camera. \"That's why we held up the aid,\" he said in October.As damaging as Mr. Bolton's account would seem to be, events of the last three years suggest it may not change the outcome. Several Republican senators on Monday dismissed it as nothing new.Mr. Trump has endured so many scandals that would have brought down an ordinary politician. Just weeks before moving into the White House, he agreed to pay $25 million to settle fraud claims against Trump University. Since becoming president, he repaid hush money given to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress, to keep quiet about an alleged affair. Another woman has accused him of rape in a defamation lawsuit, and more than a dozen others have accused him of sexual misconduct.His son, son-in-law and campaign chairman met with Russians offering \"dirt\" on his opponent that they said came from the Russian government. A special counsel investigation identified 10 instances when the president may have obstructed justice. His family foundation was forced to shut down after authorities found \"a shocking pattern of illegality.\" His businesses have benefited from foreign patrons with cause to curry favor with the president despite the Constitution's emoluments clause.Investigative reporting found that he engaged in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud. A wide swath of people around him have been convicted of various crimes, including his campaign chairman, his deputy, first national security adviser, longtime political adviser, longtime personal lawyer and others. And now Mr. Giuliani and a couple of his longtime associates are under federal investigation.To Mr. Trump's most fervent supporters, all of that is proof not that he is corrupt but that he has struck a nerve in Washington's \"swamp\" and that the establishment is coming after him, manufacturing \"hoaxes\" to tear him down. That unwavering support within Republican Party voters, which he telegraphs on Twitter regularly, has hardly gone unnoticed by Republican senators as they sit in judgment of him.But polls also show that two-thirds of the public wanted to hear from new witnesses in the trial now underway on Capitol Hill. Given the latest revelations, Mr. Bolton stands ready to testify with the fate of the president on the line.PhotographJohn R. Bolton spent 17 months as President Trump's national security adviser.

Democrats want to describe it as part of a broader struggle with Russia.WASHINGTON -- When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a curse-laden tirade to a reporter on Friday, asked, \"Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?\" he was getting at an essential element of President Trump's defense in the impeachment trial. White House officials are convinced that Americans are indifferent to what happens in the struggling former Soviet republic, and they may well be right.But the impeachment trial is about more than the fate of Ukraine -- and whether Mr. Trump sold it out for a \"domestic political errand,\" as his former adviser, Fiona Hill, put it so bitingly. To Democrats, it's about a president who undercut his own administration's stated goal of pushing back hard against Vladimir V. Putin's Russia -- the geopolitical challenge of a new, very different Cold War.It is one of those cases where the geography of the debate shapes the politics of the argument.As long as the president's lawyers can focus the debate on the narrower question of Ukraine, they can argue that the charges against the president focus on a foreign policy sideshow: how the president uses the spigot of American aid and attention to mold another country's behavior.\"They basically said, 'Let's cancel an election over a meeting with the Ukraine,\"' Mr. Trump's White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, said on Saturday, characterizing the Democrats' arguments as he opened the president's defense. Mr. Cipollone made the case that the Democrats are seeking to undo Mr. Trump's 2016 victory or fear that they cannot beat him in 2020.Yet the defense team's characterizations about Ukraine are also designed to make the impeachment charges appear to be on a fundamentally trivial affair, surrounding the treatment of a faraway country that, as Mr. Pompeo suggests, most people could not find on a map stripped of country names. (He challenged the NPR reporter, Mary Louise Kelly, to identify Ukraine, and she reported that she did.)That is precisely why the man leading the Democrats' prosecution of the case, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, focused so relentlessly on Russia last week.Mr. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, understands that Russia resonates in a way that Ukraine never can. His argument revives questions of whether Mr. Putin has some strange, still unexplained control over the American president -- which is why Mr. Schiff played the cringe-worthy tape of Mr. Trump's news conference with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, in summer 2018. In his public statements, Mr. Trump appeared to adopt the Russian leader's self-interested theory that someone else was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers in the last presidential election.\"It's a breathtaking success of Russian intelligence,\" Mr. Schiff said. \"This is the most incredible propaganda coup,\" he continued, because \"it's not just that the president of the United States standing next to Vladimir Putin is reading the Kremlin talking points. He won't read his own national security staff talking points.\"Cast that way, this is no argument over American aid to Kyiv, new details of which emerged on Sunday in an unpublished manuscript by John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser. Instead, the entire matter is part of a battle over Russia's use of Ukraine as a petri dish in disruption -- the place where Mr. Putin has experimented with seizing territory, undermining a hostile government and conducting cyberattacks that literally turned off the lights.And it is an argument over Mr. Putin's efforts to manipulate the 2020 election, at a moment when even Mr. Trump's own Department of Homeland Security says the Russians are already testing new techniques. By demanding that the new president of Ukraine investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a political opponent of Mr. Trump, and reviving theories that the Democratic National Committee's server is somewhere in Ukraine, Mr. Trump was essentially joining that manipulation effort, Mr. Schiff was saying.\"The threat that he will continue to abuse his power and cause grave harm to the nation,\" Mr. Schiff said of the president, \"is not hypothetical.\"In less partisan times -- say, when a presidential election does not loom -- Mr. Schiff's argument might strike a political chord, chiefly because it is the Republicans who, until recently, have been particularly hawkish about Mr. Putin's Russia.It is easy to forget now, but when Mr. Trump tried to water down sanctions on Russia two years ago, his own party pushed back so hard that new penalties for Moscow passed 98 to 2. (In one of the strange twists of history, one of the two opposing votes was cast by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is a leading contender to take on Mr. Trump in November.) In the House, the measure passed 419 to 3. Angry, Mr. Trump signed the bill, knowing any veto would be overturned.But the politics of impeachment are different than the politics of sanctions. So it is no surprise that, as the Republicans focus on Ukraine and the Democrats focus on Russia, both are bending the facts to fit their case.Mr. Pompeo, for example, has been known to pause his episodic blasts at State Department correspondents to make the legitimate point that it was the Trump administration that gave powerful anti-tank weapons -- called Javelins -- to Ukrainian forces, a step that President Barack Obama refused.The issue came up this weekend, as Jay Sekulow accused the Democrats of keeping that fact out of their 23 hours of arguments. \"Javelin missiles are serious weapons,\" Mr. Sekulow, the president's personal lawyer, reminded the senators at the trial on Saturday. He quoted the testimony of the two previous top American diplomats in Ukraine, including Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was recalled from her post last year, in one of the events at the center of the impeachment charges.The Javelin decision is the best piece of evidence that the Republicans have at hand that Mr. Trump has been willing to stand up to Mr. Putin. Almost everything else cuts the other way, leaving little doubt that in twisting the arm of the new Ukrainian government, Mr. Trump was not only pursuing his own political interests but also helping Mr. Putin's.Even before he was elected, Mr. Trump wondered aloud why the United States was helping Ukraine fight off the Russians. It made no sense, he argued in a March 2016 interview on foreign policy, his first extended discussion of his worldview as a candidate.\"Now I'm all for Ukraine, I have friends that live in Ukraine,\" Mr. Trump said during the interview at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida golf resort. He complained that when the Obama administration moved to impose sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and \"was getting very confrontational, it didn't seem to me like anyone else cared other than us.\"He added: \"Even their neighbors didn't seem to be talking about it. And, you know, you look at Germany, you look at other countries, and they didn't seem to be very much involved.\"In fact, they were very involved and continue to provide aid to Ukraine to prop up its democracy and its economy while often complaining about rampant corruption. But in the interview, Mr. Trump made no mention of corruption; instead, he lumped Ukraine in with the many other examples he cited of nations that the United States supports while other countries freeload.The release over the weekend of a recording of Mr. Trump at a dinner in 2018 makes clear that the president understood early in his term that unless aid continued to Ukraine, it could be easily overrun.\"How long would they last in a fight with Russia?\" Mr. Trump asked at the dinner.\"I don't think very long,\" said Lev Parnas, the Soviet émigré who worked for Rudolph W. Giuliani in pressuring Ukraine. \"Without us, not very long.\"What's missing from the record of Mr. Trump's manipulation of the aid to Ukraine last summer is any indication that he sought an assessment from the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies or his own National Security Council over whether suspending American help might, in fact, lead to the downfall of the Ukrainian government.And that, in the end, may be the most telling fact of all.If nothing else, what Americans learned from watching the impeachment trial over the past week is that Mr. Trump seemed to regard the conduct of foreign policy the way he has regarded any other policy: a chess move toward re-election rather than geopolitical advantage for the United States. Otherwise, there would be conversations weighing the benefits of restricting aid against the harm to American interests in countering the power of Russia.There is anecdotal evidence that many around Mr. Trump did in fact push back -- including Mr. Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, and the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel. Their arguments were ignored until a whistle-blower's complaint made clear that the suspension of aid to Ukraine was about to become public.So far, not one has testified as part of the impeachment process or spoken publicly about what they told Mr. Trump about the potential consequences of his domestic political errand. It is a silence that speaks as loudly as the arguments made in the Senate.PhotographDefending President Trump, Republicans have cited Javelin missile sales to Ukraine.

Democrats remain deeply critical of Mr. Trump's efforts to contain the virus and have suggested, at least for now, that they will move cautiously to help bail out the president's handling of the crisis.Democrats have expressed openness to certain measures of stimulus -- like paid sick leave and increased spending on safety-net programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps -- that could provide the building blocks for a deal with the president. And Mr. Trump's efforts could be aided by the fact that federal borrowing costs have fallen to rock-bottom rates as skittish investors in recent days have piled into safe U.S. government debt.Mr. Trump's decision to seek fiscal help amounts to concession by a White House that has ignored increasingly ominous predictions of the virus's economic effects, which have ranged from dramatically slowing growth in the United States to plunging the economy into recession.That threat was compounded over the weekend by Saudi Arabia's announcement that it would ramp up oil production, sending prices into a downward spiral and raising the threat of layoffs and shelved investments in the American oil industry.Mr. Trump and his aides had played down the economic threats as recently as Monday morning, when the president celebrated falling gas prices as \"good for the consumer\" while blaming the stock plunge on a combination of Saudi Arabia, Russia and \"fake news.\" He also suggested fears about the virus were overblown, saying more people have died from the flu than the new coronavirus. \"Life & the economy go on,\" he tweeted.By Monday evening, after the stock market fell nearly 8 percent -- its steepest losses since the 2008 financial crisis -- the president had changed his tone, conceding that those dire economic warnings could no longer be ignored heading into an election in which he planned to tout the strength of the United States economy.\"This was something that we were thrown into, and we're going to handle it,\" Mr. Trump said.He then tried to reassure investors that the economy was resilient.\"We have a very strong economy,\" he said. \"This blindsided the world.\"White House officials have known for more than a month that the virus posed a threat to public health and economic growth in the United States, but they have consistently said the economy would not need additional support to weather it. When asked about any economic fallout, Mr. Trump has put the onus on the Federal Reserve, saying it should cut interest rates and do more to stimulate growth.But investors have largely shrugged off the Fed's efforts. An emergency rate cut announced last Tuesday did little to mitigate the damage, as investors digested the economic ramifications of a virus that has shuttered factories, canceled travel and quarantined workers.A growing chorus of economists, many of them veterans of President Barack Obama's administration, have called for Mr. Trump and Congress to further support growth by injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into the consumer economy. Mr. Trump's team initially rejected such calls.Any large spending increases or tax cuts will require a deal with the Democrats who control the House and can block most legislation in the Senate. Leading Democrats gave Mr. Trump's new proposals a cool reception on Monday evening.A Democratic official on Capitol Hill said that party leaders did not like the idea of bailing out individual industries, like airlines, with targeted tax cuts. A spokeswoman for House Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee said they had not heard directly from the White House about the proposals before the news conference.\"What was glaringly missing from President Trump's news conference was how he is actually going to combat the spread of the coronavirus and keep the American people safe,\" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. \"It seems President Trump is more focused on the stock market than addressing this pandemic.\"Mr. Schumer called on Mr. Trump to propose a package that included \"ensuring tests and treatment are both available and affordable to all who need it and paid sick leave for all Americans workers, among other people-focused initiatives.\"After Speaker Nancy Pelosi convened a meeting Monday evening with her top committee chairman to discuss the Democrats' response, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, emerged to throw cold water on Mr. Trump's payroll tax cut, saying it was not \"what we need right now.\"\"What the economy needs right now is some stability and confidence that we're addressing the issue that is undermining the economy,\" he said. \"The president's answer for almost everything is a tax cut. We think we need to make sure that people, and health facilities and insurance companies and others, have confidence that they're not going to be bankrupted by this.\"Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday that the relief measures proposed by the White House would ensure that Americans do not have to worry about losing their jobs or missing paychecks because of the coronavirus.Mr. Trump's comments came after he met with his economic advisers on Monday afternoon. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, are expected to present the stimulus proposals to Republican lawmakers on Tuesday.Mr. Mnuchin said at the briefing that he had been having daily conversations with Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He insisted that the administration would use all tools at its disposal to ensure that the United States economy was in good shape a year from now.\"This is not like the financial crisis,\" Mr. Mnuchin said. \"This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months.\"The Treasury secretary also raised the possibility of directing the Internal Revenue Service to provide tax relief to companies that are affected.\"We're looking at alternatives at the I.R.S.,\" Mr. Mnuchin said, noting that tax payments would soon be due.A Senate Finance Committee spokesman, Michael Zona, said on Monday morning that its Republican chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, was \"exploring the possibility of targeted tax relief measures that could provide a timely and effective response to the coronavirus.\"He added, \"Several options within the committee's jurisdiction are being considered as we learn more about the effects on specific industries and the overall economy.\"Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Nicholas Fandos and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographVice President Mike Pence at a coronavirus briefing on Monday.

Sondland, the founder of a hotel chain who donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee, recalled from his post as the ambassador to the European Union on the same day that Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a decorated Iraq war veteran on the National Security Council staff, was marched out of the White House by security guards.The ousters of Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman -- along with Mr. Vindman's brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, an Army officer who also worked on the National Security Council staff -- may only presage a broader effort to even accounts with the president's perceived enemies. In the two days since his acquittal in the Senate, Mr. Trump has railed about those who stood against him, calling them \"evil,\" \"corrupt\" and \"crooked,\" while his press secretary declared that those who hurt the president \"should pay for\" it.Even as he began purging administration officials who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump assailed a Democratic senator who he had hoped would side with him during the trial but did not and called on the House to \"expunge\" his impeachment because he deems it illegitimate.The flurry of actions and outbursts drew quick condemnation from Democrats, who said the president was demonstrating that he feels unleashed, and complicated the politics of impeachment for moderate Republicans who stood by him while arguing that he had learned his lesson and would be more restrained in the future.\"There is no question in the mind of any American why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House,\" David Pressman, Colonel Vindman's lawyer, said in a statement. \"Lt. Col. Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful.\"Colonel Vindman spoke publicly only once, after being ordered to under subpoena, Mr. Pressman added. \"And for that, the most powerful man in the world -- buoyed by the silent, the pliable and the complicit -- has decided to exact revenge.\"Mr. Sondland took a more measured approach, confirming that he had been dismissed without offering any protest.\"I was advised today that the president intends to recall me effective immediately as United States ambassador to the European Union,\" he said in a statement hours after Colonel Vindman's dismissal. \"I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary Pompeo for his consistent support and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the U.S. Mission to the European Union.\"Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman were key witnesses in the House impeachment hearings. Mr. Sondland, who was deeply involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Trump's Democratic rivals, testified that \"we followed the president's orders\" and that \"everyone was in the loop.\" Colonel Vindman, who was on Mr. Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, testified that it was \"improper for the president\" to coerce a foreign country to investigate a political opponent.It may have been untenable for them to keep working for a president with whom they broke so publicly, but the White House made no effort to portray the ousters as anything other than reprisals. Mr. Trump foreshadowed Colonel Vindman's fate hours ahead of time when asked if he would be pushed out. \"Well, I'm not happy with him,\" the president told reporters. \"You think I'm supposed to be happy with him? I'm not.\"The president continued to assail lawmakers who voted for conviction, targeting Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who bitterly disappointed Mr. Trump by sticking with his party. \"I was told by many that Manchin was just a puppet for Schumer & Pelosi,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \"That's all he is!\"Even as Mr. Trump flew to North Carolina to highlight his economic record, he called on the House to \"expunge\" his impeachment, an idea with no precedent or basis in the Constitution. \"They should because it was a hoax,\" he told reporters. \"It was a total political hoax.\" And he accused Ms. Pelosi of committing a crime by ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address. \"She broke the law,\" he asserted.The president's critics had warned that he would feel unbound if acquitted, and some said the dismissals proved their point, quickly calling them \"the Friday night massacre,\" as Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, put it.\"These are the actions of a man who believes he is above the law,\" said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House impeachment manager. Mr. Schumer said the White House was running from the truth. \"This action is not a sign of strength,\" he said. \"It only shows President Trump's weakness.\" Ms. Pelosi said, \"This goes too far.\" At the Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. asked the audience to stand in support of Colonel Vindman.The White House would not discuss the Vindman decision. \"We do not comment on personnel matters,\" said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the National Security Council.Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, celebrated the dismissals, offering mock thanks to Mr. Schiff. \"Were it not for his crack investigation skills, @realDonaldTrump might have had a tougher time unearthing who all needed to be fired,\" he tweeted.\"The president had every right to make the moves that he did today,\" Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, said in an interview. \"Moving Lt. Col. Vindman, for example, is a good move based on the fact that there is a lack of trust. He disagrees with the president's policies.\" As for Mr. Sondland, \"the president can recall an ambassador at any time with or without cause, and in the case of Gordon Sondland, the guy was a hot mess, anyway.\"Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, expressed no regrets over Mr. Sondland's dismissal. \"Somehow I think America will be able to deliver foreign policy without Gordon Sondland,\" he said by text message.Other witnesses have left with less drama recently. Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post last spring because she was seen as an obstacle to the president's plans, retired last month from the Foreign Service. William B. Taylor Jr., who replaced her in an acting capacity, was essentially brought back early, as well. And Jennifer Williams, a career official working for Vice President Mike Pence, quietly returned to the Defense Department.Several had already left government, like Fiona Hill, the Europe policy chief at the National Security Council, and Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine, who resigned days before testifying. But others remain, including George P. Kent at the State Department, Laura Cooper at the Defense Department and David Holmes at the embassy in Ukraine.Mr. Sondland began discussions with senior officials about leaving shortly after he testified in November, according to two people briefed on the matter. He believed that remaining would be unrealistic given his role in impeachment and hoped to exit gracefully.A decision on timing was postponed until after impeachment, but on Friday, State Department officials told Mr. Sondland that they wanted him to resign, the people said. Mr. Sondland relayed to them that he would not step down amid what was clearly a purge of impeachment witnesses and that he would have to be fired, they said. In response, State Department officials recalled him.Colonel Vindman's brother seemed to be collateral damage. Yevgeny Vindman, who goes by Eugene, worked as a lawyer for the National Security Council and had no role in the impeachment hearings other than showing up to sit behind his brother when he appeared in November. He was given no explanation for his dismissal \"despite over two decades of loyal service to this country,\" said Mr. Pressman, the lawyer. \"He deeply regrets that he will not be able to continue his service at the White House.\"Both Vindmans, whose White House tours were scheduled to last until July, will retain their Army ranks and return to military service. Alexander Vindman, who had been expecting the move and had begun removing personal items, was told he would go to the Pentagon before moving to the National War College in July as originally planned. Yevgeny Vindman was more surprised and was told he would report to the office of the Army general counsel.Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said service members who return to the military would be welcomed back. \"We protect all of our persons, service members, from retribution or anything like that,\" he told reporters.Mr. Trump, on the other hand, has made clear his personal antipathy for both Vindmans. \"Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, right?\" he said on Thursday during a rambling hourlong venting session at the White House, his voice dripping with disdain. \"We had some people that -- really amazing.\"On Friday, Mr. Trump retweeted a message from a supporter advocating Alexander Vindman's dismissal: \"Vindman's behavior is a scandal. He should be removed from the @RealDonaldTrump White House ASAP to protect our foreign policy from his machinations.\"Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican who voted to acquit the president but expressed hope that he would learn a lesson from the impeachment, said witnesses should not be punished. \"I obviously am not in favor of any kind of retribution against anyone who came forward with evidence,\" she said in Maine, according to The Portland Press Herald.Colonel Vindman has been subjected to virulent attacks on his patriotism on Fox News and social media. The president called him a \"Never Trumper,\" a term the colonel rejected. Fox aired a segment suggesting his service in the White House might amount to \"espionage.\" And Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, attacked him on Twitter: \"How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America's greatest enemy?\"With impeachment over, Mr. Trump is debating additional personnel changes. Some advisers are encouraging him to part ways with his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who was involved in freezing security aid to Ukraine, which paved the way for impeachment.Other advisers are telling Mr. Trump to delay major changes until after the November election. Some hope that Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, will join the White House as a senior adviser. Mr. Meadows traveled with the president on Friday to North Carolina.Mr. Trump denied that Mr. Mulvaney would be pushed out in favor of Mr. Meadows. \"I have a great relationship with Mick,\" the president told reporters on Friday. \"I have a great relationship with Mark. And it's false.\"Peter Baker and Michael S. Schmidt reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman and Danny Hakim from New York.

Here are some of them.WASHINGTON -- With President Trump's impeachment trial getting underway, Democrats are intensifying their demands for more testimony and documents that could add to the already voluminous evidence against him and bolster their case by shedding new light on several key questions.Despite the White House strategy of blocking testimony from top officials and rejecting demands for documents, the Senate will have in front of it various accounts of how Mr. Trump eagerly sought to persuade Ukraine's new president to pursue investigations into two matters that could benefit him in his re-election campaign. Those matters are dealings in Ukraine involving former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, and purported Ukrainian meddling in the American 2016 presidential election.But in part because of the White House's decision not to cooperate, the record of actions by Mr. Trump and his underlings is riddled with gaps -- and new evidence has been surfacing at the 11th hour. Testimony from Mr. Trump's senior advisers could illuminate how overt the president's efforts were, though it is unclear if that would persuade any Republican senators to abandon their defense of the president.On Sunday, Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead House impeachment manager, said he was concerned that the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency were withholding information about Ukraine out of fear of angering the president.\"The N.S.A. in particular is withholding what are potentially relevant documents to our oversight responsibilities on Ukraine, but also withholding documents potentially relevant that the senators might want to see during the trial,\" Mr. Schiff, Democrat of California, said on ABC's \"This Week,\" referring to the National Security Agency.Republicans called those complaints proof that the case against Mr. Trump was so weak that Democrats were scrambling to bolster it. \"But this, to me, seems to undermine or indicate that they're getting cold feet or have a lack of confidence in what they've done so far,\" Senator John Cornyn of Texas said Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\"Even before new information emerged in recent days -- including material from Lev Parnas, who worked closely with the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to seek damaging information about the Bidens and to impugn the United States' ambassador in Kyiv -- the Senate's 100 jurors faced unanswered questions that go to the heart of the matter.What exactly did John R. Bolton, then the White House's national security adviser, see and hear last year that convinced him a group of diplomats and aides were cooking up a geopolitical \"drug deal\" involving Ukraine?How often and how thoroughly did Mr. Giuliani, the chief engineer of the pressure campaign, brief the president on what he was up to? What has Mr. Trump said behind closed doors about his order to freeze military aid to Ukraine?Democrats in the Senate want to call Mr. Bolton to the stand, compel the testimony of three other top Trump aides, including the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and obtain the records that the administration has withheld. But they would need the support of at least four Republican senators to do so.\"A fair trial, everyone understands, involves evidence,\" Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"Evidence would be documents and witnesses. We know the president has refused to provide documentation beyond the July 25 telephone memo. And he's refused to provide basic witnesses who actually heard what happened on that conversation and saw what happened afterwards.\"Here are some of the key questions that more witness testimony or additional documents could address:To what extent did Mr. Giuliani act at Mr. Trump's direction and keep him apprised of his efforts?Some Trump allies have tried to suggest that Mr. Giuliani was a rogue actor pursuing his own interests in Ukraine. But Mr. Giuliani said last spring, as he planned a trip to Ukraine to press for investigations into the Bidens, that his efforts had Mr. Trump's full support and that the president \"basically knows what I'm doing.\"Mr. Trump has called Mr. Giuliani a \"crime fighter\" who was \"seeking out corruption\" because he was \"very, very incensed at the horrible things that he saw.\" He also said Mr. Giuliani had the right to look into whether the Ukrainians helped sow the seeds for the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.Mr. Giuliani has insisted that his conversations with Mr. Trump are protected by attorney-client privilege. He has pointed out that Kurt D. Volker, then Mr. Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, put him in touch with a top Ukrainian aide whom he met in August in Madrid.Unquestionably, Mr. Trump sought to vest Mr. Giuliani with at least some informal authority to operate on his behalf. He urged President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, during a phone call on July 25, to consult Mr. Giuliani about the investigations he wanted. And he urged his own diplomats and aides involved with Ukraine to consult with Mr. Giuliani after they returned from Mr. Zelensky's inauguration in May.Among them was Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, who testified that Mr. Trump instructed him to \"talk to Rudy\" about Ukraine, and said that Mr. Giuliani had made it clear to him that he spoke for the president.In a letter in May from Mr. Giuliani that Mr. Parnas turned over last week to House investigators, the president's lawyer told Mr. Zelensky that he was acting with Mr. Trump's \"knowledge and consent.\" Mr. Parnas, who faces felony charges involving campaign finance violations, said in interviews that Ukrainian officials met with him because Mr. Giuliani assured them that he represented both him and Mr. Trump.But virtually nothing is known about the substance of communications between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump, although they appear to have spoken regularly. Mr. Mulvaney told associates that he would leave the room whenever the men would talk in order to preserve attorney-client privilege.Did Mr. Trump explicitly link the freeze of military assistance to Mr. Zelensky's public announcement of investigations?Whether the president decided to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine for his own political gain, at the expense of the nation's strategic foreign policy interests, is at the crux of the case against him. His decision thwarted the will of Congress, undercut an American ally enmeshed in a war with Russia and, according to a report last week by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, violated American law.During the House inquiry, Mr. Sondland testified that he had informed Ukraine that it would most likely not receive the aid unless it was willing to commit to carrying out the investigations Mr. Trump wanted. But he also testified that Mr. Trump insisted to him there was no \"quid pro quo\" -- although only after the aid freeze had become public and the president had been told about the whistle-blower complaint setting out details of the pressure campaign.Democrats in the Senate are seeking testimony from four other witnesses who played key roles in White House deliberations about the suspension in aid: Mr. Bolton; Mr. Mulvaney; Robert B. Blair, a senior adviser to Mr. Mulvaney, and Michael Duffey, the associate director of the Office of Management and Budget.The New York Times reported last month that many administration officials involved in carrying out the aid freeze were kept in the dark about the president's motivations.Mr. Mulvaney said at a news conference in October that the aid had been withheld in part because Mr. Trump wanted an investigation into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election. Mr. Mulvaney later said that was not true, and that the aid was withheld only because of concerns about Ukraine's willingness to battle corruption and about whether other nations were providing their fair share of aid to Ukraine.In mid-August, Mr. Bolton unsuccessfully tried to persuade Mr. Trump to lift the freeze. In an Oval Office meeting later that month, Mr. Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper asked the president to release the funds but were rebuffed.Mr. Duffey, a political appointee, enforced the hold on the aid after taking control of the funds from a career budget officer, Mark Sandy -- a highly unusual move.On July 25, after days of exchanges about the topic but also just 90 minutes after Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky held their fateful telephone conversation, Mr. Duffey reiterated to Defense Department officials in an email that no funds should be disbursed -- instructions he said should be \"closely held\" because of \"the sensitive nature of the request.\"How much did other top aides know about the president's demands that Ukraine announce investigations?\"Everyone was in the loop.\"That was Mr. Sondland's characterization of who knew what about the push to win a commitment from the Ukrainians to announce the investigations. He testified that several top officials, including Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Mulvaney, knew that Mr. Trump would extend an Oval Office invitation to Mr. Zelensky only if Ukraine publicly announced the investigations.Fiona Hill, at the time the top Russia specialist on the National Security Council, testified that at a White House meeting on July 10, Mr. Sondland said that he had a deal with Mr. Mulvaney: an Oval Office invitation for Mr. Zelensky in exchange for a public statement that the inquiries were underway.Although the State Department refused Mr. Sondland's request for documents to support his testimony, he produced several emails to back up his assertions. On July 18, he wrote a group of officials -- including Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Bolton and Rick Perry, then the energy secretary -- that Mr. Zelensky was ready to promise the president in their upcoming phone call that his prosecutors would \"turn over every stone.\"Mr. Pompeo was among the officials who listened the July 25 phone call, in which Mr. Trump raised with Mr. Zelensky the need to investigate the Bidens and the 2016 election and Mr. Zelensky seemed to agree.In August, Mr. Sondland wrote Mr. Pompeo that Mr. Zelensky would deliver a public statement that \"will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation\" because it would include \"specifics.\" That meant, he testified, that Mr. Zelensky would name Burisma, a Ukrainian company that had hired Hunter Biden, as an investigative target, along with the 2016 election.Did Vladimir V. Putin and Viktor Orban sour Mr. Trump on Ukraine?A number of State Department witnesses blamed Mr. Giuliani for Mr. Trump's animus toward Ukraine, saying they struggled mightily to counteract his influence. But there are indications that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary helped solidify Mr. Trump's views.Mr. Volker, the envoy to Ukraine, testified that the president's negative opinion of Ukraine was \"very deeply rooted\" and evident as far back as September 2017, when Mr. Trump met Mr. Zelensky's predecessor Petro O. Poroshenko in the Oval Office.One explanation is that Mr. Trump blamed the Ukrainians for helping to expose the financial misdeeds of Paul Manafort, who was forced to resign as Mr. Trump's campaign chairman in August 2016 and is now in prison for his crimes. In an Oval Office meeting on May 23, Mr. Trump insisted to his aides that Ukrainians were \"terrible people\" who \"tried to take me down.\"But George P. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified that Mr. Trump's view of Mr. Zelensky and Ukraine had darkened in the interval between that meeting and his first phone call with the Ukraine leader a month earlier, in which he congratulated him on his victory.In the interim, Mr. Putin reportedly disparaged Mr. Zelensky to Mr. Trump in a phone call on May 3. And Mr. Trump held an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Orban, who is antagonistic toward Mr. Zelensky. No transcripts of those conversations have been released. Mr. Kent attributed the shift in Mr. Trump's attitude to the combined influence of those two foreign leaders and Mr. Giuliani.Where were the White House lawyers?A group of government lawyers is charged with monitoring White House and National Security Council decisions for unethical or illegal behavior. The top-ranking lawyers involved in the Ukraine affair were John A. Eisenberg at the National Security Council and Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel.Two security council staff members -- Ms. Hill and Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman -- told Mr. Eisenberg they feared that Mr. Sondland was improperly pressuring Ukraine to benefit Mr. Trump politically. Ms. Hill testified that Mr. Bolton had ordered her to tell Mr. Eisenberg that he did not want any part of \"whatever drug deal\" that Mr. Sondland and Mr. Mulvaney were cooking up.According to people familiar with the situation, Mr. Eisenberg shared those concerns with Mr. Cipollone, his superior, but rejected Mr. Cipollone's advice that he bring them up with the president.Colonel Vindman also reported concerns about the president's July 25 phone call. Mr. Eisenberg warned him not to discuss the call with others and ordered that access be restricted to the reconstructed transcript. A person briefed on his actions said officials misinterpreted that directive as an order to put the transcript on the White House's most secure computer.Mr. Eisenberg eventually alerted the Justice Department to the July 25 call, but only weeks later, after the C.I.A.'s top lawyer informed him that a C.I.A. officer had filed an anonymous complaint about it.Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York.

Republicans on the committee challenged the conclusions and Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing the briefing to happen.Intelligence officials have also concluded that the Russians are seeking to help Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic presidential primaries.At an afternoon campaign rally in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump continued with his accusations that Democrats were behind the reports and said they were trying to \"poison our democracy\" and were circulating \"vile\" hoaxes.\"I was told a week ago,\" the president said. \"They said, 'You know they're trying to start a rumor.' It's disinformation. That's the only thing they're good at. They're not good at anything else. They get nothing done. Do nothing Democrats.\"During the final event of a four-day swing through the West, Mr. Trump suggested that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would prefer Mr. Sanders. Mr. Trump claimed, inaccurately, that Mr. Sanders \"honeymooned in Moscow.\" And while Mr. Sanders did visit Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union in 1988 a day after his wedding, the trip was made to work out a sister-city relationship between Yaroslavl and Burlington, Vt., where Mr. Sanders was mayor at the time. In his 1997 autobiography, Mr. Sanders described the trip as a \"very strange honeymoon,\" but he and his wife went on a more traditional honeymoon a year later in St. Lucia, in the Caribbean.Mr. Trump, who has been cheerful in public and private about his re-election prospects, used the trip to raise millions from high-dollar donors and charm his political base at rallies in three states. And by returning every night to Las Vegas and holding his final rally there, he also tried to divert attention from Saturday's Democratic caucuses in Nevada.The president has visited every state that has held a primary or caucus so far this year, making trolling Democratic candidates a cornerstone of his campaign strategy.At his rally on Friday, the president called up members of the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice\" men's hockey team to take the stage behind him and waxed at length about his reality show \"The Apprentice.\"\"Speaking also of reality television: This is the greatest show of all time, huh?\" the president said. \"I have to get back to Washington and work. I feel guilty. This is too much fun.\"Mr. Trump spoke for nearly two hours and fired the crowd up with a litany of claims about his accomplishments during his first three years in office, many of them exaggerated or misleading.During an extended discussion about the dangers of illegal immigration, Mr. Trump noted that \"illegal crossings are down 75 percent from last spring.\" He did not mention that the decrease followed a huge surge in border apprehensions on his watch, leaving the number about where it was when he took office.Aside from appearing unbound and ebullient on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump also used the trip as an opportunity to take on some favorite targets, casting doubt on assorted institutions at every turn.He voiced his suspicions about Saturday's Nevada caucuses, comparing it to the disastrous ones held in Iowa earlier this month.\"I hear their computers are all messed up just like they were in Iowa,\" he said.The president described members of the media as \"the most dishonest human beings in the world\" and accused law enforcement of harboring \"dirty cops.\"He also repeatedly joked with the crowd that he would stay president longer than two terms, a comment he has made at other events.Mr. Trump has a long history of dismissing the assessments made by intelligence agencies that he has deemed unfair or unflattering.Multiple agencies have determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and, before the 2018 midterms, delivered warnings that Russia was prepared to do it again. Early in his presidency, Mr. Trump grudgingly accepted those assessments before falling back on personal assurances from Mr. Putin.\"He said he didn't meddle,\" Mr. Trump said in November 2017. \"I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. Every time he sees me, he says, 'I didn't do that.' And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.\"Since then, Mr. Trump, with the assistance of his Justice Department, has moved to retaliate against the intelligence community rather than Mr. Putin. A federal prosecutor is scrutinizing how intelligence officials assessed Russia's 2016 election interference, targeting the former C.I.A. director John O. Brennan in particular.Mr. Trump's anger at the intelligence assessment delivered on Feb. 13 to lawmakers was magnified by the presence at the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and played a lead role in the impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.The president's decision to remove Mr. Maguire and install Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and a fervent loyalist, was also seen as a direct outcome of the briefing.On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, an ally and a vocal opponent of impeachment, was one of the candidates under consideration as a permanent successor. By Friday morning, Mr. Collins said he was not interested.\"This is not a job that interests me; at this time, it's not one that I would accept because I'm running a Senate race down here in Georgia,\" Mr. Collins said in an interview on Fox News. Mr. Trump then wrote on Twitter that he had a list of four candidates to succeed Mr. Grenell, and that he would make his decision in the coming weeks.Michael D. Shear and Linda Qiu contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump brushed off an intelligence finding about Russian election interference as a partisan attack against him.

But within the United States, as the coronavirus spreads from one community to another, he has been more follower than leader.While he presents himself as the nation's commanding figure, Mr. Trump has essentially become a bystander as school superintendents, sports commissioners, college presidents, governors and business owners across the country take it upon themselves to shut down much of American life without clear guidance from the president.For weeks, he resisted telling Americans to cancel or stay away from large gatherings, reluctant even on Thursday to call off his own campaign rallies even as he grudgingly acknowledged he would probably have to. Instead, it fell to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government's most famous scientist, to say publicly what the president would not, leading the nation's basketball, hockey, soccer and baseball leagues in just 24 hours to suspend play and call off tournaments.Mayors and county executives, hospital executives and factory owners received no further direction from the president as he talked about the virus in the Oval Office on Thursday than they did during his prime-time address to the nation the night before. Beyond travel limits and wash-your-hands reminders, Mr. Trump has left it to others to set the course in combating the pandemic and has indicated he was in no rush to take further action.\"If I need to do something, I'll do it,\" the president told reporters on Thursday. \"I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.\" But he again emphasized that the crisis was not as bad as many imagine. \"Compared to other places, we are in really good shape,\" he said, \"and we want to keep it that way.\"By contrast, Leo Varadkar, the visiting prime minister of Ireland sitting next to him, said that as of Friday, his country was closing all schools and banning indoor gatherings of more than 100 people and outdoor gatherings of more than 500 -- the kind of measures that some American states and cities are taking on their own rather than wait for the president.Mr. Trump had no hesitance to kibbitz from the side before he became president, assailing President Barack Obama for not doing enough to stop Ebola, for instance. But his own White House has separated into camps of those who think the administration needs to be doing more and those who share -- and reinforce -- Mr. Trump's own view that the news media is overreacting to and creating a panic around the coronavirus.After feeling besieged by enemies for three years, Mr. Trump and some of his advisers view so many issues through the lens of political warfare -- assuming that criticism is all about point scoring -- that it has become hard to see what is real and what is not, according to people around the president. Even when others with Mr. Trump's best interests at heart disagree, they find it hard to penetrate what they see as the bubble around him.Thomas P. Bossert, a former homeland security adviser to Mr. Trump, has tried repeatedly in recent days to be patched through to the president or Vice President Mike Pence to warn them just how dire the coronavirus pandemic really is, only to be blocked by White House officials, according to two people familiar with the events. It left him to try to get the president's -- and the public's -- attention through newspaper op-ed articles, television appearances and Twitter messages like the one that panned Mr. Trump's Europe travel ban as \"poor use of time & energy.\"Mr. Bossert, who has publicly warned that as many as 500,000 Americans may ultimately die of the coronavirus, denied on Thursday that he had tried to see Mr. Trump and been unable to, but would not elaborate on his contacts with the White House. Some officials there also denied that he had made extensive efforts to speak with Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence.Among the advisers who share the president's more jaundiced view is his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who considers the problem more about public psychology than a health reality, according to people who have spoken with him. Mr. Kushner has gotten more involved in the response in recent days, according to three White House advisers. A person close to Mr. Kushner said his views were being misinterpreted, and that he was focused on trying to find answers to the most immediate measures to mitigate the virus's spread.Marc Short, Mr. Pence's chief of staff, approached Mr. Kushner on Monday about integrating the White House teams working on the issue, as the vice president's communications shop is overrun with media requests and the White House is changing the chief of staff. After that, Mr. Kushner seized more of a role, spending Wednesday with Mr. Trump, the officials said.One administration official said on Thursday that Mr. Kushner, his wife, Ivanka Trump, and Hope Hicks, a presidential adviser who has just returned to the White House, favored Mr. Trump giving Wednesday night's prime-time address to calm the waters amid rampaging uncertainty and fear.Ms. Trump, the president's eldest daughter, in particular favored the address, according to three administration officials. But the subject quickly became contentious internally, according to several administration officials. Drafts were written and rewritten, beginning around 5 p.m., with Mr. Kushner seen as in charge as the president's chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, wrote, and the communications office of the West Wing left out of the discussions.By early evening, only two hours before the camera was to go on, it was still not entirely clear what Mr. Trump was going to say. In a meeting in the Cabinet Room, a number of top officials told the president the speech was a good idea, with a notable exception being the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who said that Mr. Trump ought to wait at least a day or two so as to provide officials with more information. The president told aides gathered in the room, who disagreed on exactly how far he should go in terms of a travel ban from Europe, to come up with something and bring it to him, according to a person with direct knowledge of the events.The health experts were either supportive of or neutral about a proposed ban on some European travelers, even as Mr. Mnuchin disagreed, and so the plan moved forward, with other items -- like more specific recommendations for schools and crowds -- left unmentioned.When the camera turned on, the president appeared uncomfortable, reading words from the teleprompter in a stiff manner that made no emotional connection to a television audience of millions scared about a virus they cannot see and uncertain about a society rapidly transforming around them.Even with the text on the screen, the president mischaracterized his own policies in a way that required his administration to correct him afterward. Administration officials said there were two errors in the teleprompter text, and one that Mr. Trump garbled as he read it, adding the word \"only\" in a sentence that was intended to say the ban did not apply to trade and cargo, a line that spooked markets.He referred to the pandemic as a \"foreign virus\" that \"will not have a chance against us\" as if it were a hostile nation to be defeated on the battlefield. But while he talked about measures to prop up the economy, he did not discuss the troubles with the availability of testing kits or express understanding of the changes in everyday life affecting so many Americans.Some close aides did not think the errors in the speech were particularly significant. By Thursday morning, it was clear that the speech had not assuaged the financial markets, which plummeted another 10 percent, the worst single day since Black Monday in 1987. Together with the losses of recent weeks, the markets have now erased about 85 percent of the gains of the entire Trump presidency, gains that were the foundation of his argument for re-election.\"Real leadership in this crisis is going to have to come from governors, from public health officials and from institutional leaders,\" Rod Dreher wrote on The American Conservative's website. \"We saw tonight that even when Trump is trying to be on his best behavior, he just doesn't have much of a clue about the nature of the crisis, or how it can best be fought.\"Others were more willing to give him some benefit of the doubt. Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, which had just harshly criticized the president's \"failures of leadership\" in handling the outbreak, saw some progress in the speech even as he expressed concern that it would not last.\"The speech represents a marked, welcome improvement in the president's rhetoric,\" he wrote, \"but that won't matter if he goes out and undercuts it tomorrow, and the ultimate verdict on his response will be rendered based on the results.\"The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page likewise called the speech \"a step toward more realism\" but added that Mr. Trump was not forthcoming enough about the scope of the problem.Republicans close to the White House privately laid blame at the feet of Mr. Kushner. A person close to Mr. Kushner described that as unfair, saying that he was merely helping out and that it becomes easier to blame him when things are difficult. And in any case, a partial travel ban on Europe was a bold move that may have been bound to rattle the markets rather than calm them no matter what.The White House insisted that the president's actions have had the support of health officials, and that local communities should make decisions based on their own conditions. Aides said the speech demonstrated to Americans that Mr. Trump understands the situation and is determined to react strongly to guard their well-being.\"The reaction has been very favorable across the country,\" Mr. Pence said Thursday on Fox News.Speaking on NBC's \"Today\" show, Mr. Pence agreed it was wrong to dismiss the outbreak as hype. \"Obviously there's been some irresponsible rhetoric, but the American people should know that President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety and well-being of the people of this country,\" he said, without identifying who was responsible for the irresponsible rhetoric.As for Mr. Trump's call on Washington in his speech to \"stop the partisanship,\" that lasted just nine hours, at least some of which he was presumably asleep. By dawn on Thursday, he had already tweeted or retweeted attacks on Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographThe president failed to express understanding in the changes to everyday life affecting Americans.

We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back!\"\"The state of our union,\" Mr. Trump declared, \"is stronger than ever before.\"Welcomed by enthusiastic applause from Republican lawmakers, the president marched confidently into the same historic chamber where he was impeached 49 days earlier. Mr. Trump described the nation as enjoying what he called a \"blue-collar boom,\" fueled by trade agreements and his success in \"restoring our nation's manufacturing might.\"On the eve of a Senate vote expected to acquit him, Mr. Trump never mentioned the impeachment inquiry that has threatened his presidency and consumed Washington. But his interactions on Tuesday night with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who started the investigation by Democrats that has forever stained his legacy, underscored the deep bitterness between them.As he arrived at the rostrum, Mr. Trump turned to hand copies of his speech to Ms. Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence. But when Ms. Pelosi offered her hand to shake, the president pointedly turned away without taking it.Seated just behind the president, Ms. Pelosi grimaced and shook her head several times during his address. Moments after Mr. Trump finished and was basking in applause from Republicans, the speaker ripped up the pages of his speech, holding them high for the cameras to catch her unmistakable statement of scorn.With the theatrical touches of a showman-turned-president, Mr. Trump surprised the wife of an Army soldier with the soldier's return home from battle, highlighted the story of a 100-year-old Tuskegee airman and his 13-year-old great-grandson, and -- in a remarkable moment -- awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, the combative conservative talk radio host and for decades a villain to the left.Standing next to Mr. Limbaugh, who recently learned he has advanced lung cancer, Melania Trump, the first lady, draped the medal around his neck as Mr. Trump thanked him for \"decades of tireless devotion to our country.\"As the president fights for a second term in an election that will require him to broaden his appeal, he boasted of increasing funding for historically black colleges and singled out several African-Americans in the House chamber for praise, a striking departure for a president who derided African nations as \"shithole countries\" and repeatedly criticized the city of Baltimore, represented at the time by one of the nation's leading black politicians, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, who died last year.At the same time, Mr. Trump used the speech as a clarion call to his most conservative supporters, prompting some Republicans in the chamber to chant, \"Four more years.\" The president also boasted that he was building \"a long, tall and very powerful wall\" across the southwestern border and vowed to oppose what he called a \"socialist takeover\" of the health care system by Democrats in Washington and those running to replace him in the White House.\"To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American health care!\" Mr. Trump declared.Even as he delivered his remarks, it was Democrats who were in disarray, still unable to declare a final winner in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. State officials said they expected to release more results later Tuesday evening in a botched election process that Mr. Trump was quick to mock online.\"The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster,\" the president crowed on Twitter earlier in the day. \"Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is 'Trump.\"'Mr. Trump was not the first president to face his accusers even as they try to remove him from office. In 1999, President Bill Clinton delivered his State of the Union address to Congress in the middle of his impeachment trial on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from a sexual harassment lawsuit. Mr. Clinton did not mention the Senate trial, then still underway.Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Trump did not use the nationally televised address to reprise his daily rants about impeachment, his made on Twitter. Instead, Mr. Trump -- who is infamous for his rambling, invective-filled speeches at his rallies -- largely stuck to an optimistic, if not always bipartisan, script.The president did not unveil any major new initiatives, but called on Congress to pass bills to encourage school choice, lower prescription drug prices, provide a small amount of funding for neonatal research, ban late-term abortions and work toward improving the nation's roads, bridges and tunnels.As he has done each year, Mr. Trump focused a large part of the speech on immigration. He called on Congress to ban \"free government health care for illegal aliens\" and to pass legislation allowing the victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants to sue so-called sanctuary cities.The president described a \"gruesome spree of deadly violence\" by an undocumented immigrant in California and introduced the brother of one of the victims, Rocky Jones, who was shot eight times.\"Our hearts weep for your loss,\" Mr. Trump told the victim's brother, Jody Jones, \"and we will not rest until you have justice.\"The title of the president's speech was \"The Great American Comeback,\" a more formal slogan that combines the sentiments of \"Make America Great Again,\" the president's viral phrase from the 2016 campaign, and the more recent \"Keep America Great\" mantra that he has used to fire up crowds at rallies.In his speech, he bragged about significant economic successes, even \"though predictions were that this could never be done.\" But his boast to have added 12,000 new factories overstated his claim to delivering an economic miracle to white working-class voters in the industrial Midwest.Employment in construction, manufacturing and mining combined grew more slowly last year than at almost any other point in the current expansion. Manufacturing employment growth slowed to less than 50,000 jobs for the year in 2019, the worst rate of his presidency and the second-worst of the long recovery from recession.Turning to trade, he said he had succeed in revising the North American Free Trade Agreement, something supported by many Democrats as well as Republicans.\"Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do absolutely nothing,\" Mr. Trump said, asserting the successes without acknowledging the more nuanced reality. \"But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises.\"In the official Democratic response to Mr. Trump's speech, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan challenged the president's boasts about the economy.\"It doesn't matter what the president says about the stock market,\" Ms. Whitmer said. \"What matters is that millions of people struggle to get by or don't have enough money at the end of the month after paying for transportation, student loans or prescription drugs.\"Many of the female Democratic lawmakers attending the speech were dressed in white, symbolizing the suffragist movement and women's rights. Several Democratic lawmakers, including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, were not in attendance after announcing they were boycotting it.\"I will not use my presence at a state ceremony to normalize Trump's lawless conduct & subversion of the Constitution,\" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.While discussing national security, Mr. Trump celebrated in macabre terms two targeted killings he had ordered in recent months.He hailed the October raid leading to the death of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, whom Mr. Trump called \"a bloodthirsty killer\" and whose demise he cast as justice for the murder of Kayla Mueller, a young American humanitarian worker kidnapped in Syria in 2013. Mr. Trump said that Ms. Mueller, whose parents he introduced, was \"tortured and enslaved by ISIS\" after \"more than 500 horrifying days of captivity.\"The president also recalled with relish the Jan. 3 missile strike that killed the Iranian commander Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a \"ruthless butcher\" who Mr. Trump said had \"orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women and children.\"He cast Mr. Suleimani's death as another act of patriotic vengeance, recalling the Iranian's role in supplying bombs believed to have killed hundreds of American soldiers during the Iraq war, and telling the story of an American soldier, Christopher Hake, \"who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country\" when his Bradley vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.And in a brief passage noting his desire to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, Mr. Trump assured that he was \"not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people\" in the country, \"many of them innocent.\"The president introduced a parade of guests during his speech, including a 13-year-old boy with aspirations to join the Space Force and Charles McGee, his 100-year-old great-grandfather, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen. Mr. Trump said he promoted Mr. McGee to brigadier general in a ceremony at the White House before the speech.In addition to Mr. McGee, the president highlighted the story of Tony Rankins, an Army veteran who fought back from drug addiction, and Stephanie Davis, to whom he granted an Opportunity Scholarship for her fourth-grade daughter, Janiyah, to go to the school of her choice. All were African-American.Mr. Trump also introduced the wife and son of an Army staff sergeant who died in Iraq by a roadside bomb supplied by General Suleimani.At another point, the president singled out Juan Guaidó, the leader of Venezuela's opposition movement, who received his most visible show of support yet from Mr. Trump: a seat in the president's guest box for the State of the Union.Many White House aides had hoped to have the impeachment trial behind them before Mr. Trump's speech. But as it turned out, his third State of the Union address was part of a remarkable political collision on the calendar: He delivered the speech a day before the final impeachment vote and a day after Iowans participated in the first voting of the 2020 campaign season.There is no question that the president will be acquitted on Wednesday by the Republican-controlled Senate, giving him the chance to claim vindication in what he views as an attempted political assassination by his enemies. But he will forever be the third impeached president in American history and only the first to ask voters for re-election after being charged with committing high crimes and misdemeanors.Set in motion last year by Ms. Pelosi after Democrats took control of the House in 2018, the move to impeachment was directed by House managers during a two-week Senate trial. It was built on damning evidence that the president withheld security aid for Ukraine and a coveted Oval Office meeting as leverage for investigations that could damage the political fortunes of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden.Tuesday was the second day that senators announced their judgments on the president's behavior, delivering speeches on the Senate floor. Notable among them were the condemnations of Republicans who accepted the truth of the accusations against Mr. Trump even as they said they planned to vote to acquit him.\"The president's behavior was shameful and wrong,\" Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said Monday night on the Senate floor even as she denounced an unfair, fiercely partisan process and announced, \"I cannot vote to convict.\"Reporting was contributed by Peter Baker, Jim Tankersley, Lara Jakes, Michael Crowley and Maggie Haberman.Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump with Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday night during the State of the Union address.

Schiff, the House's lead impeachment manager, accused President Trump on Sunday of trying to threaten him on Twitter and urged Republican senators to find the \"moral courage to stand up\" to a \"wrathful and vindictive president.\"Mr. Trump, writing on Twitter Sunday morning, attacked Mr. Schiff as \"a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man,\" warning, \"He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!\"It was an extraordinary back-and-forth between a member of Congress and a sitting president, coming at a turning point in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors -- the third presidential impeachment trial in American history. Mr. Schiff's comments, on the NBC program \"Meet the Press,\" came as Mr. Trump's legal team planned to resume its defense of the president when the Senate reconvenes Monday at 1 p.m.\"Look at the president's tweets about me today saying that I should pay a price,\" Mr. Schiff said on \"Meet the Press.\"\"Do you take that as a threat?\" asked Chuck Todd, the show's host.\"I think it's intended to be,\" the congressman replied.Mr. Schiff has been under fire from Republicans for mentioning a news report during the trial that alleges that the White House had threatened to put their heads \"on a pike\" if they voted to convict. He doubled down on that claim Sunday, saying that he merely meant it would require fearlessness on the part of the senators.Once Mr. Trump's defense team wraps up its case, senators will have an opportunity to ask questions and then vote on whether to call witnesses or subpoena new documents. Unless at least four Republicans join Democrats to vote to expand the scope of the proceedings, the trial could wrap up as early as this week with Mr. Trump's expected acquittal.At least two Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine, who is running for re-election this year, and Mitt Romney of Utah, elected in 2018 -- appear to be leaning toward calling witnesses. But Mr. Trump, in an interview that aired on Fox News's \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" said doing so could be \"very bad\" for Republican senators who are up for re-election.\"I think it would be very bad for the Republican Party if we lost that great unity that we have right now,\" Mr. Trump said in the interview, which was taped at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"Some of them are running, and I think it would be very bad for them.\"Democrats have been pushing for four witnesses -- including John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, who wrote in an unpublished manuscript that the president conditioned security aid to Ukraine on investigations into Democrats -- over the strong objections of Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. Some Republicans are floating the idea of a witness swap in which they would call either former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. or his son Hunter Biden, both of whom Mr. Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate, even though neither has direct knowledge of Mr. Trump's behavior.Democrats have opposed such a move, and Mr. Schiff suggested on Sunday that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, should rule on that question.\"We have a very capable justice sitting right behind me who can make decisions about the materiality of witnesses,\" Mr. Schiff said, adding, \"We trust the Supreme Court justice.\"If history is any guide, Chief Justice Roberts will be reluctant to do so. When President Bill Clinton was tried in the Senate in 1999, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist used his authority sparingly, leaving most questions to the Senate to decide.Lawmakers on both sides -- along with Alan Dershowitz, a consultant to Mr. Trump's legal team -- took to the Sunday morning talk show circuit to make the case for or against Mr. Trump. The president was impeached by the House in December on charges that he abused his oath of office and obstructed Congress by pressuring the leader of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals and then covering it up by concealing evidence from lawmakers.Mr. Schiff and his team of prosecutors maintain that the president was trying to influence the 2020 election for his personal gain. During an abbreviated session of the Senate on Saturday, the president's team pushed back hard on that assertion, arguing that it was the Democrats who were trying to undo the results of the 2016 election -- and to interfere with the one in 2020.\"They're asking you to tear up all of the ballots all across the country on your own initiative, take that decision away from the American people,\" Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, said of the House managers, adding: \"They're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history, and we can't allow that to happen.\"Mr. Dershowitz, speaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" backed away from an assertion he made in 1998, when Mr. Clinton was facing possible impeachment in the House, that a crime is not needed to remove a president from office. Mr. Trump's team has argued that he cannot be convicted or removed because he is not accused of violating a law -- an argument Mr. Dershowitz said he now agreed with because he had done more research.\"I've been immersing myself in dusty old books, and I've concluded that no, it has to be a crime,\" Mr. Dershowitz said. \"That's what scholars do, that's what academics do. We do more research.\"Mr. Schiff has emerged as a polarizing figure in the trial. His speech on Thursday telling lawmakers they could \"not trust this president to do what is right for this country\" went viral -- and earned even grudging respect from some Republicans. But on Friday, he invoked a CBS report that cited an anonymous source saying Republican senators had been warned their heads would be \"on a pike\" if they voted against Mr. Trump.In so doing, Mr. Schiff angered several centrist or swing-state Republicans -- including Senators Collins and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- who are potential votes in favor of having witnesses. The congressman said Sunday that he was not intending to offend.\"It is going to be very difficult for some of these senators to stand up to this president. It really is. There's no question about it,\" he said. \"I don't want to acknowledge it in a way that is offensive to them, but I do want to speak candidly about it -- and if this weren't an issue, there wouldn't be an issue about calling witnesses.\"Democrats on Sunday came to Mr. Schiff's defense. During a conference call with reporters, Representative Sylvia Garcia, Democrat of Texas and a House impeachment manager, said Republicans should be disturbed by Mr. Trump's behavior, not Mr. Schiff's.\"If you look at this president and his behavior, he has done some very outlandish things, so it kind of surprised me that Mr. Schiff referencing a news report would be so offensive to them,\" she said. \"The president's behavior should outrage them to the highest degree.\"Chris Cameron contributed reporting.PhotographRepresentative Adam B.

Biden Jr. cautioned that the Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to false information in the general election.ANAMOSA, Iowa -- As the Democratic presidential candidates fanned out across Iowa and New Hampshire on Thursday to address voters still scarred by President Trump's victory in the 2016 election, Joseph R. Biden Jr. argued that any Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to baseless criticism and disinformation in the general election.Mr. Biden's remarks in Iowa, at his first political event of the 2020 election year, came a day after a deceptive video of him circulated online, highlighting how campaigns are still struggling to combat false information on the internet.\"You're going to see a lot more of not only my statements being taken out of context and lied about or altered, you're going to see whomever the Democratic nominee is, because that's how this guy operates,\" Mr. Biden said, adding that Democratic candidates would face unfair attacks from Mr. Trump \"if I were to drop out of the race tomorrow\" or \"if I were to drop dead tomorrow.\" (There was no evidence that the video was connected to the president.)Mr. Biden's comment came in response to an event attendee who asked him about his ability to beat Mr. Trump, and also to clarify his remarks in the video, which had been misleadingly edited to wrongly suggest that Mr. Biden was making racist remarks. In fact he was emphasizing the need to change \"our culture\" around violence toward women.Still, the video spread rapidly on social media, amplified by many right-wing verified users on Twitter, including reporters at conservative news outlets, the former speaker of the Missouri House and Republican strategists, according to data compiled by Vinesight, a company that detects disinformation on social media. It is an online environment that alarms many Democratic voters who are gripped by anxiety over how best to defeat Mr. Trump.The president, who was impeached in the House of Representatives in connection with asking Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, is comfortable only in a \"mosh pit,\" said Mr. Biden, who has faced months of false or exaggerated attacks from Mr. Trump and other Republicans.Still, he argued that the Democratic Party was in a far stronger position today to confront Mr. Trump than in 2016, noting support for the president's impeachment among some voters -- \"Hillary didn't have that advantage\" -- and saying that in the previous campaign, not everyone took Mr. Trump seriously.In response to the questioner, who also asked whether he was running a better campaign than Hillary Clinton had, Mr. Biden offered a wide-ranging answer and relitigated how Mrs. Clinton handled a debate after Mr. Trump was caught on tape bragging about making unsolicited sexual advances.He suggested that Mrs. Clinton could have changed the subject, pivoting to how she hoped to change voters' lives. Instead, Mr. Biden said, \"she did what every other candidate probably would have done\" by lacing into his character, yielding an ugly debate, and \"it all went down the drain.\" Yet before that debate even started, Mr. Trump had invited several women who had made allegations against former President Bill Clinton to join him for a photo opportunity.Mr. Biden also noted sexism as he discussed the last campaign, which he called \"unfair,\" but added, \"That's not going to happen with me.\"It was not just Mr. Biden who was ruminating on the 2016 election on Thursday; Mrs. Clinton's loss in the Electoral College was on the minds of other candidates as well as voters.At a campaign office opening in Plymouth, N.H., the entrepreneur Andrew Yang told voters: \"Donald Trump is our president today because he had a very simple message -- he said he was going to 'make America great again.' What did Hillary Clinton say in response? 'America is already great.\"'\"That did not quite work,\" Mr. Yang said. \"The problems are real. The struggles are real. Many Americans are being left behind. But Donald Trump's solutions were not what we need.\"And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, campaigning at a town-hall-style event in Concord, N.H., was asked by a voter whether she would work to unite the party around the Democratic nominee if it was not her. The voter noted how some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont did not rally behind Mrs. Clinton in the general election against Mr. Trump.Ms. Warren began a lengthy answer by first committing to party unity: \"Every single person who is in the race for the Democratic nomination for president would make a far better president than Donald Trump,\" she said to applause.\"I'm in all the way,\" she added, and started making the case for differences between the 2020 race and the 2016 campaign -- chiefly, in her telling, the palpably greater determination and intensity among Democrats to beat Mr. Trump.\"What we have to remind ourselves is, 2020 is not 2016. The world has changed,\" she said, recalling the protest marches after Mr. Trump's inauguration and the Democratic victories in 2018 in the House of Representatives and key governorships, and in 2019 in Kentucky, Louisiana and Virginia.\"We are getting stronger and we are in this fight,\" she said. \"2020 gives us this remarkable moment that is very different from '16 or '12 or '08 or however far you want to go back. This moment where Americans are off the sidelines.\"Saying that \"the door is open a crack\" to an era of major reforms and the end of \"business as usual,\" she added: \"Think about it -- a nation that elects someone like Donald Trump is a nation that has got serious problems. Going back is not where we want to be. Our chance in 2020 is to look at that crack, drop our shoulder, run hard at it and build the America we want to be.\"Asked for comment, a Republican National Committee spokesman, Steve Guest, said, \"Insulting half the country didn't work for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and it won't work for the Democrats in 2020, either.\"Mr. Sanders, another leading progressive in the race, also waded into the debate over how to defeat Mr. Trump as he uncorked some of his fiercest criticism of Mr. Biden to date in an interview with The Washington Post.\"It's just a lot of baggage that Joe takes into a campaign, which isn't going to create energy and excitement,\" Mr. Sanders said. \"He brings into this campaign a record which is so weak that it just cannot create the kind of excitement and energy that is going to be needed to defeat Donald Trump.\"Mr. Sanders on Thursday reported an eye-popping fund-raising haul of more than $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to his campaign, ahead of Mr. Biden at $22.7 million -- Mr. Biden's strongest quarter to date -- as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose campaign reported more than $24.7 million.Even as Mr. Sanders sharpened his attacks on Mr. Biden in the interview, he largely stuck to his familiar message on the trail in Iowa on Thursday, denouncing income inequality and championing his signature policy proposal, \"Medicare for all.\" At a canvass kickoff in Grinnell, he jokingly named a young girl as his running mate.As he boarded his new campaign bus after that event, he briefly answered a question about his fourth-quarter fund-raising, calling attention specifically to the more than five million contributions his campaign had received since he entered the race. \"That tells me the kind of grass-roots support that we have and tells me why we're going to win the nomination and why we're going to defeat Donald Trump,\" he said.Reporting was contributed by Patrick Healy and Matt Stevens from Concord, N.H.; Sydney Ember from Muscatine, Iowa; and Nick Corasaniti from New York.PhotographJoseph R.

President Trump awarded a young girl in the audience a scholarship. He had his wife, Melania, drape a Presidential Medal of Freedom around the paleoconservative shock jock Rush Limbaugh. He arranged a reunion between a deployed soldier and his wife, just like the surprise-military-return videos that TV morning shows love.And all these planned moments may have been overshadowed by a drama-filled, two-part installment of \"The Real Politicians of D.C.,\" co-starring his antagonist Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House. Before he began his speech, he appeared to refuse her offer of a handshake; after he finished, she ripped up her copy of it on camera.Neither of them, it seems, came there to make friends.For the president, the address had obvious political goals, coming amid the impeachment trial and at the beginning of an election year. But it also seemed built to make noise and get lasting attention amid a crazy-busy political news week.A State of the Union address, even in calmer times, is an evanescent thing. A president strikes a temporary tone, rattles off some aspirational proposals that will probably never materialize and the press polishes it off by noon the next day.This time, unusually, President Trump found himself sandwiched, like a network public-service announcement, into the space between two bigger political stories.Since Monday night, network news crews had been searching the haunted cornfield into which the results of the Iowa Democratic caucus had vanished. Hours before the speech, when cable analysts would normally be predigesting State of the Union nuggets, CNN's John King and MSNBC's Steve Kornacki were speed-swiping through a belated dump of caucus data.And the day after his address, the president had an appointment with predestination, as the Senate was scheduled for a Wednesday vote that would, barring shocking news or mass hypnosis, acquit him on impeachment charges.Indeed, if you've been following the impeachment saga, the State of the Union was like Washington's most ambitious crossover event, with not only the senator-jurors present but also Chief Justice John Roberts (whom Mr. Trump chatted up on his way down the aisle) and figures mentioned in the testimony, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.The president, however tempted, never mentioned impeachment. Instead, he began with a long string of economic statistics and boasts. Congressional Republicans rose and clapped, sat, rose and clapped again, sentence after sentence, a P90X workout of election-year fealty. (They set a raucous tone early, chanting \"Four more years!\" in case you weren't clear on the subtext.)For well over an hour, Mr. Trump offered a preview of his re-election argument, a long list of superlatives followed by an effort to soften his image for swing voters, followed by rehardening it for his base.Several times, he spotlighted Americans of color as his guests -- the scholarship winner, an elderly former Tuskegee Airman whom he had promoted to brigadier general -- continuing an effort to broaden his appeal to minorities, or at least reassure white voters turned off by the demonizing of Mexicans, the insults of Haiti and Africa and the caging of Latin American children at the border.All this followed a Super Bowl campaign ad featuring an African-American woman that focused on criminal justice reform instead of appealing to his base -- which not long ago he stoked with attacks on black football players who knelt in protest during the national anthem.The speech also took sharp turns from sentimental to ominous, like the negative part of a campaign ad where the music turns scary and the screen shades to black and white. The president continued a long-running theme of connecting immigrants and violent crime, deploring sanctuary city policies for releasing \"dangerous criminal aliens.\" (Studies in fact show that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than native-born Americans.)Over all, this was oddly both the most and the least traditional State of the Union President Trump has given, a comfortable, familiar list of campaign arguments that then veered into sweeps-month theatrics. It took the decades-long tradition of presidential guest stars, which began when Ronald Reagan invited the hero of a plane crash in 1982, and amped it up for the age of reality TV.The production seemed designed in part to remind Americans of the munificent Donald Trump persona molded by Mark Burnett on \"The Apprentice\" for a decade. On that show, he was not just the tough-talking \"you're fired\" guy, but a dispenser of treats, rewards and mercy, who presided over celebrity challenges for charity and swept contestants off for trips to Mar-a-Lago and rides in his personal helicopter, like a pinstriped Santa.We can wonder what Mr. Trump's presidency would have been like if he had leaned into that side of his TV character from the beginning, rather than the shark from the \"Apprentice\" boardroom who fomented conflict, browbeat losers and relished fights. He certainly seemed more comfortable Tuesday in the mode of expansive, backslapping master of ceremonies than he ever has reciting his staffers' text from the prompter.But now, every stage-managed segment arrives in a context. His overtures to minority Americans come with his presidential history on race. Mr. Trump knows how this works; once upon a time, \"The Apprentice\" had a higher Q Score popularity rating with Hispanic and African-American than white audiences -- until he embraced the birther conspiracy against Barack Obama, whose legacy his address also worked hard to undermine.In a way, the structure of this State of the Union was a battle against context. It didn't construct a sweeping arc so much as try to generate clips to use online, in ads, on Fox News. Like much of President Trump's rhetoric, it was more movie trailer than movie, a series of blowups each of which sought to Etch-a-Sketch the memory of the last.But it may have itself been Etch-a-Sketched. It's possible that nothing in the speech will get more attention than the Great Pelosi Rip, custom-made to be transmuted into memes and draw cheers and jeers from partisans and inspire arguments among the agonizing-over-civility class.This is America's political style now, a product of the Trump administration as visible as a segment of border wall. Donald Trump argued that he has delivered America a lot of things -- and one of them, as the speech ratified, was the transformation of the presidency and public life into a 24-hour reality show.Tuesday night, he asked the country whether it wanted to renew this production for four more seasons.PhotographPresident Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday night, heavy on spectacle, came during a tumultuous week in politics.

Let these Kentucky women count the ways.He refused to hold hearings on Merrick Garland, for one. And he stood by Brett M. Kavanaugh to the end.But for these seven Republican women, gathered for coffee on a recent Friday, the Senate impeachment trial revealed Mr. McConnell's leadership as the handiwork of the divine. \"I think it was a plan designed only by God that Senator McConnell was put in the position that he is,\" said Kathy Stocks, the chairwoman of the Scott County Republican Party.When Mr. McConnell, the majority leader and Kentucky's senior senator, secured President Trump's acquittal on Wednesday, he took to the Senate floor to extol the end of \"this precedent-breaking impeachment.\" It was a final bow of sorts, the capstone of a yearslong metamorphosis from establishment bore to conservative icon.Even voters like Ms. Stocks weren't so sure about Mr. McConnell once upon a time, when Tea Party firebrands tempted them with visions of a new kind of Republican. But that was before the fate of Mr. Trump was at stake, before the fight for acquittal demanded a leader precisely in Mr. McConnell's mold.From beginning to end, impeachment has crystallized the symbiosis between the president's success and Mr. McConnell's clout. It's easy to see how the Senate leader has been critical to Mr. Trump's political survival. Perhaps less obvious, though, is the extent to which Mr. McConnell owes much of his new viability to Mr. Trump -- how his brand of staid ruthlessness has thrived as a counterweight to the brash, whim-driven style of the president.All of the things that once repelled many conservatives about Mr. McConnell have now become the foundations of his appeal. According to the Kentucky women, no longer is the 77-year-old lawmaker past his prime -- he is \"battle tested.\" His likeness -- white, wrinkled, expressionless with a dash of smirk -- is not the aesthetic of a has-been; it is the portrait of \"stability.\" And three-plus decades in office? Don't call him a career politician, just the ideal shepherd for the man who has never done this before.\"He knows that he's not only representing the country as our Senate majority leader, but he is representing the president of the United States,\" Ms. Stocks said. \"And he is doing his best to make sure the president is taken care of the way that he should be.\"Kentucky Republicans often discuss the president as if he were a child prodigy -- a virtuoso who, for all his \"genius\" and \"creativity,\" as one woman here put it, still needs a parent to drive him to the show.Enter Mitch McConnell. Constituents like Ms. Stocks may grimace at Mr. Trump's vagaries, the flurry of tweets that, before she turned the notifications off, would often wake her and her husband at 3 a.m. But they find comfort in knowing that when it comes to the president's actual agenda, Mr. McConnell is behind the wheel.Basha Roberts, 65, recalled an event in Kentucky after Mr. Trump was elected where she heard Mr. McConnell say, for the first time, \"We're working to make America great again.\"\"I knew then that he had bought in,\" she said, \"and could see all that he could do working with President Trump.\"'We need someone like Harry Reid'The way Mr. McConnell complements the president cannot alone explain his now-widespread support in his party -- how it is that in the past five years, his approval rating among Republicans nationally has climbed to 68 percent from as low as 26 percent, according to surveys from Gallup and Quinnipiac University.At no point has Mr. McConnell fundamentally changed. For many Republicans, the difference today is that he is despised by all the right people.Ms. Roberts recalled watching one of the first Democratic presidential debates and realizing that the candidates had spent more time name-checking Mr. McConnell than they had the president. \"I called my husband in and said: 'Guess what? Senator McConnell is doing everything we want him to do,\"' she said. \"'He's become what they're attacking!\"'It is difficult to overstate the political currency of being labeled a \"fighter.\" As Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist, put it, the only thing more universal than a party's desire for fighters is the belief that only the other side has them. This was particularly true for Republicans in President Barack Obama's first term, even after they installed John Boehner as speaker.\"At that time, you started to hear grousing about how weak Republicans were, particularly Boehner,\" Mr. Donovan said. The prevailing line of thinking, he explained, was that \"G.O.P. leadership is always weak, and we need someone like Harry Reid who's willing to be strong.\"Perhaps no leader in recent memory has haunted the Republican Party quite like Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader from 2007 to 2015. Here was a man who appeared to heed Mr. Obama's call during the 2008 election, when he reminded supporters of \"the Chicago way,\" as immortalized by Jimmy Malone in \"The Untouchables\": \"If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.\"For Republicans, the assumption of a knife may have seemed generous. Lawmakers like Mr. Boehner rose on the promise of legislative victories, only to have Mr. Reid ensure that most House spending bills never saw the Senate floor. While Republicans did manage to secure the occasional half-loaf, be it an extension of Bush-era tax cuts or the imposition of automatic budget cuts, it was never enough to dispel an underlying sense of futility. As conservatives saw it, government-funding negotiations inevitability ended in spending packages that largely took care of Democratic priorities, coupled with the image of a Republican Party that had yet again capitulated.All of which may have fueled the party's deep \"resentment\" for Mr. Reid and the left writ large, Mr. Donovan has written. But those feelings, he noted, were \"often tinged with envy, if not begrudging admiration.\"Indeed, Mr. Reid helped entrench the perception that Democrats were willing to play hardball -- and, more important, that they were all willing to play hardball. There were no stragglers, it seemed, in Mr. Reid's party, no Susan Collinses or Lisa Murkowskis to fret over.The irony, of course, is that Mr. Reid's image as a craven conductor was in many ways the product of Mr. McConnell himself, whose relentless use of the filibuster often meant that Mr. Reid had to rely on party-line governance. But it was as if Republicans, in fixating on their opponents, had failed to acknowledge that the ruthlessness they craved in their leaders was already well at work.Some conservatives still invoke Mr. Reid's memory in this way. \"That's the problem with the Republican Party, there's not enough loyalty -- Democrats at least have that,\" Angela Carr, a 44-year-old Republican from Colorado, said at a recent breakfast hosted by the Denver G.O.P.\"You don't hear a Democrat is a D.I.N.O.,\" or a Democrat in Name Only, she continued. \"You hear a Republican is a R.I.N.O.\"A Supreme Court barricadeIt was hardly an hour after Justice Antonin Scalia's death had been confirmed that on Feb. 13, 2016, Mr. McConnell issued his career's most radioactive pledge yet: The Senate would not confirm a replacement Supreme Court justice until after the 2016 election.Senate Republicans fell in line. And they stayed there -- even after Mr. Obama nominated Mr. Garland, an appellate judge largely viewed as a centrist, and even as polls showed that Democrats were likely to keep the White House. In a speech in Kentucky that August, Mr. McConnell said that \"one of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.\"'Of the nearly two dozen Kentucky Republicans interviewed for this article, each one cited this moment -- culminating in Neil M. Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court -- as foundational to Mr. McConnell's now-hallowed place in the party. Yet for all the lionizing of Mr. McConnell as a \"statesman,\" as a \"man of principle,\" not one of them seemed bothered by his vow to ignore the so-called Garland rule should a Supreme Court vacancy arise in 2020. In May, when asked how he would proceed in that scenario, Mr. McConnell grinned. \"Oh,\" he said, \"we'd fill it.\"Nick Nash, a 24-year-old \"hard-line conservative\" who lives in Louisville, was among the unbothered. In his view, Mr. McConnell was simply acting as the \"fighter\" that the Republican Party had long needed. \"The way D.C. is set up now, when you're in charge, you make the rules,\" Mr. Nash said. He shrugged. \"I think Harry Reid would have said the exact same thing.\"For Republicans, the Garland example meant that Mr. McConnell's resolve to confirm Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in October 2018 was not so much exceptional as it was expected. \"He was not going to be bullied,\" said Dawn Alvarado, 52, a occupational therapist. \"And there are so many bullies.\"Many also pointed to Mr. McConnell's role in confirming federal judges. \"Who has ever been able to appoint 187 judges to the federal courts in a president's one term?\" boasted April Hunt of Danville, Ky. Her husband, Howard Hunt, the judge executive of Boyle County, chimed in approvingly: \"Nobody.\"Republicans young and old spoke of these judges as the \"safeguard for our future.\" But young voters also praised their installment as the premise of Mr. McConnell's growing cultural infamy.Reclaiming 'Cocaine Mitch'On a recent Wednesday evening, Mr. Nash joined three other young Republicans for dinner at an Irish pub in Louisville. They laughed about how Mr. McConnell's opponents had tried in vain to demonize him. \"People\" -- as in \"the left\" and \"the media\" -- \"put these tags on him and think it's hurting him, but it's really only glorifying him,\" said Taton Thompson, 30, who is leading the recharter of the Kentucky Young Republicans.They reveled in their favorite nicknames for Mr. McConnell. There was \"Cocaine Mitch,\" given to him by a Republican, no less. \"Honestly, so many high school and college students thought that was like the coolest thing ever,\" said Addison Combs, 20, the chairwoman of the Bellarmine University College Republicans.And then there was \"Moscow Mitch,\" popularized by Speaker Nancy Pelosi after the Senate leader blocked election-security legislation, which Mr. McConnell's team appropriated as a beverage.\"He's a bro,\" Ms. Combs concluded. \"He's a total bro.\"Max Atherton, a 27-year-old finance director at a car dealership, who described himself as a \"Brooks Brothers Republican,\" echoed as much. \"It's ironic in a way that someone who is over 70 years old has almost kind of injected a bit of youth and jest into the Republican Party,\" he said.This is perhaps the unlikeliest manifestation of Mr. McConnell's leadership. Sure, the judges appointed during this time will figure prominently for decades to come. But in considering the less quantifiable ways in which the Senate leader has recast his party, one might return to that speech from May, when he said, without pause, that he would fill a Supreme Court vacancy this election year.Mr. McConnell's every move then seemed calibrated to enrage his opponents, to inspire some new macabre moniker. The sly grin, the casual sips of water. Yet it is precisely this aura -- call it ruthlessness, or shamelessness -- that has found purchase among conservatives, particularly young ones. Indeed, when a party's watchwords are increasingly to \"own the libs,\" grounded in a cold tally of victories over any discernible ideological framework, it is no wonder Republicans have found their fighter in Mr. McConnell.\"He's somebody we can look up to,\" Mr. Thompson said.Democrats, of course, believe Mr. McConnell is the exact inverse of a political guidepost. But when the dust of the Trump era settles, and the Senate leader's legacy becomes clearer, if only on the scoreboard, their voters may decide that his is the model worth following.In July 2018, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, was scheduled to have an event in Brooklyn. Travel issues stopped him from showing. His constituents, heat-frazzled and anxious about Mr. Trump's impending Supreme Court pick, criticized Mr. Schumer when he finally phoned into the venue.\"We are in a gunfight and we have a butter knife,\" one person said.Then another constituent offered a complaint that, as recently as five years ago, Republicans probably never imagined they would hear: \"You've not played to win like Mitch McConnell has.\"PhotographSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, on Wednesday after the Senate voted to acquit President Trump of two counts.

Jeff Sessions was a backbench senator from Alabama who defied the Republican president and doomed a bipartisan immigration bill with claims it would let terrorists and child molesters pour across the border.Donald J. Trump was working on the seventh season of his reality TV show \"The Apprentice\" and was still registered in New York State as a Democrat.Thirteen years later, after serving a brief and tormented tenure as President Trump's attorney general, Mr. Sessions wants his old job in the Senate back.But he is vexed by a bitter irony as he competes against several other Republicans in a March 3 primary. The Jeff Sessions of the past, who became a beloved figure on the right and helped fuel a populist brush fire that challenged Republicans over the very issues that are now at the heart of Mr. Trump's nationalist agenda, is a distant memory for many Alabama voters.Ask Republicans today what they think of Mr. Sessions, who represented Alabama in the Senate for 20 years, and many of the same belittling adjectives that Mr. Trump has hurled at his former attorney general come spilling out.\"He was weak,\" said Stasia Madej, the owner of a women's clothing boutique in Huntsville. She was in between bites of her barbecue dinner on a recent weeknight at a Republican candidates' forum where four of Mr. Sessions's opponents were speaking.\"I was hoping he'd be here tonight so we could hear answers to all of the questions we want to ask. I have doubts since he recused himself,\" added Ms. Madej, who declared, \"I love Trump,\" as she started in on Mr. Sessions.The episode to which Ms. Madej was referring may be the one act in Mr. Sessions's long career that tips his Senate run in Alabama: his recusal from the Justice Department's investigation into the Trump campaign's dealings with Russia in 2016. That prompted the appointment of Robert S. Mueller as special counsel and enraged Mr. Trump, who continued his public taunts and insults of the former attorney general -- \"VERY weak\" and his \"biggest mistake\" as president -- long after he forced him out in November 2018.Mr. Sessions's predicament says a lot about a Republican Party that Mr. Trump has turned into a vessel for his own political security, held together not by shared beliefs but instead by fealty to him. No one was more of an evangelist for the ideas Mr. Trump ran on than Mr. Sessions. Yet his political fate is now threatened because the president has declared him disloyal.\"We live in a time now when if you don't fall on your sword for the president, you're done,\" said John Castorani, a candidate for Congress from the Mobile area and a self-described moderate Republican, who said Mr. Sessions did the right thing by recusing himself. \"I was proud to be from Alabama -- for a moment,\" added Mr. Castorani, a 27-year-old veteran and former intelligence officer.\"When we criticize Trump, we are no longer patriots, we are country-hating liberal hacks,\" he said. \"I'm not going to fall on my sword for him. And if that keeps me from getting elected, I'm O.K.,\" he said.The negative effect of Mr. Trump's barrage against Mr. Sessions became clear in interviews with 20 Alabama voters. Most brought up the recusal with no prompting. Many said they held it against their former senator, though some admired him for sticking to his principles. And even those who couldn't recall what exactly Mr. Sessions did had heard enough to understand that whatever happened was bad for the president.\"I know he did something that made the president mad,\" said Susan Woodman, a retired speech therapist who came away from the Huntsville event undecided but impressed with one of Mr. Sessions's rivals, Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach.Mr. Tuberville introduced himself to the audience by saying his biggest reason for wanting to serve in Washington was \"to help Donald Trump\" -- be it on trade or foreign policy or fighting political correctness in schools that he complained teach \"climate change, diversity and all that crap.\"All of the candidates have pledged in no uncertain terms to help Mr. Trump and his agenda if elected. Mr. Sessions's bet is that he can claim something more convincing: He was on board with that agenda first.\"I have a certain authenticity on this that I will acknowledge I don't think others have,\" Mr. Sessions said in an interview at a \"Pork & Politics\" mixer in Mobile recently. Referring to his opponents, he said there was a difference \"between demagoguery and honest advocacy for the American people's interests.\"\"They're good people,\" he added of his rivals. \"I just don't think any of those candidates understand the significance historically of the issues that we are talking about.\"The last time Mr. Sessions ran for Senate, in 2014, he was considered so unbeatable that no one ran against him on either ticket, Republican or Democratic. He was famous for railing against Wall Street bankers and Silicon Valley executives as villains from a Tom Wolfe novel, calling them \"masters of the universe\" who were putting \"the parochial demands of a few powerful C.E.O.s ahead of an entire nation's hopes.\"During the Obama administration he opposed fellow Republicans who wanted to negotiate new agreements to lower barriers to trade, saying in 2015, \"I think we are at a point in history where we cannot afford to lose a single job in this country to unfair trading practices.\"He also broke with his party on Social Security and Medicare spending, favoring an approach that would avoid the steep cuts that party leaders like Paul D. Ryan had supported as a matter of fiscal responsibility.Working in Mr. Sessions's office at the time as his communications director was Stephen Miller, now the White House adviser most associated with Mr. Trump's hard-line approach to immigration.In February 2016, when most of Mr. Sessions's colleagues still considered Mr. Trump a joke, he became the first senator to endorse him for president.There is a depth to Mr. Sessions's early bond with Mr. Trump that none of his rivals can challenge. Mr. Tuberville has never held political office. Representative Bradley Byrne, who represents a district in southern Alabama, won his seat in 2013 after beating a Tea Party insurgent, thanks in large part to a flood of money from major corporations like Pfizer, Caterpillar and AT&T. After the \"Access Hollywood\" tape came out a month before the 2016 election, Mr. Byrne called on Mr. Trump to step aside for Mike Pence.Lately, Mr. Byrne has wrapped himself in the president's agenda. At the Huntsville forum, his campaign literature fanned out on the tables declared, \"We can trust Bradley to stand with President Trump.\" He managed to insert Mr. Trump's name into almost every answer he gave that night, starting with his introduction to the crowd: \"I'm a Christian. I'm a conservative,\" he said. \"And I vote with President Trump 97 percent of the time.\"So far, polls show Mr. Sessions leading Mr. Byrne, Mr. Tuberville and a third opponent, Roy S. Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court whose campaign for Senate in 2017 unraveled amid accusations that he had forced himself on teenage girls, costing Republicans the seat.Mr. Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet about this year's race. Should Mr. Sessions prevail in the primary next month but not win an outright majority, a runoff election would not happen for several weeks. And that prospect makes Mr. Sessions's allies nervous because of the ample time it would allow the president to call off his cease-fire.Though Mr. Trump is famous for disregarding advice, he has heeded warnings so far from numerous advisers about attacking the former attorney general. According to several people familiar with the conversations, his aides have pointed out that any attempt to interfere could backfire, as it did in 2017 when Mr. Trump backed two candidates in Alabama who lost: Luther Strange, who lost in the primary to Mr. Moore, and then Mr. Moore.With the exception of a few influential conservatives -- including Fox News's Tucker Carlson, who in an interview last year with the Huntsville radio host Jeff Poor said that \"Sessions was Trump long before Trump,\" and Laura Ingraham, who in 2014 said Mr. Sessions should be president -- most Republicans seem to have conveniently forgotten Mr. Sessions's contributions to Trumpism. Mr. Carlson and Ms. Ingraham remain fans. And since Mr. Sessions announced his campaign in November on Mr. Carlson's show, he has been on their prime-time Fox programs a total of nine times.When the Sessions campaign released a list of 11 former Senate colleagues who were endorsing him, they were all people who were safe from the reprisals and attacks from the president that most Republicans fear. None are running for re-election this year; two are retiring; two others are in their mid-80s; and one, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, already left the Senate at the end of last year because of health issues.Though Mr. Sessions said he had not spoken to the president since he left the Justice Department over a year ago, preserving the themes of the 2016 Trump campaign inside a party that was often hostile to them is a major reason he wants to be in the Senate.Asked whether he believed there were a lot of Republicans who would revert to the party orthodoxy on trade and immigration once Mr. Trump is out of office, he said: \"That's my concern. I think there are a number of them that are kind of looking for that wave to go away. And they'll go back to business as usual.\"PhotographA supporter of Jeff Sessions in Mobile, Ala., last month.

That changed when the Democratic incumbent announced he was becoming a Republican, with the president's support.AVALON, N.J. -- President Trump has few reservations about undermining members of his own party, and David Richter was no exception.Mr. Richter, a millionaire former chief executive of one of the nation's largest construction companies, for months had been considered the front-runner in the 2020 Republican primary for New Jersey's Second Congressional District.But that all changed on Dec. 19, when the district's incumbent, Representative Jeff Van Drew, one of three Democrats to vote against impeachment, appeared in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump. Mr. Van Drew announced he was leaving the Democratic Party to become a Republican -- and he had won the president's endorsement in the process.\"I assumed I was going to win, and win handily. And that all gets upended,\" Mr. Richter said in an interview at his home in Avalon. \"Donald Trump did what was in the best interest of Donald Trump.\"The endorsement was hardly a day old before Mr. Richter's institutional support began to crumble. His top advisers phoned in their apologies and said they were headed to work for Mr. Van Drew. The National Republican Congressional Committee scrubbed Mr. Richter, 52, from its 2020 Young Guns program, which is meant to highlight rising stars in the party.Mr. Richter has remained in the race, but he now finds himself campaigning ostensibly in support of both the man and the institution that rejected him. As even longtime Republican lawmakers can attest, the merest dissent against this president can wreak havoc on one's career, often in the form of 280 characters.Mr. Richter, whose political life has conversely just begun, is already running as Donald Trump's roadkill.There had been no classes on this when Mr. Richter attended Harvard's Kennedy School -- what to do when your presumed general election opponent, once denounced by Republicans for his \"socialist policies,\" is suddenly your party's hero, beaming alongside the president in an Oval Office chair typically reserved for visiting heads of state.It didn't matter that in his one term in Congress, Mr. Van Drew had stuck with Democrats on issues like Mr. Trump's border wall, or that he'd endorsed Senator Cory Booker for president. What mattered was that Mr. Trump had spoken.\"He's not only running against Jeff Van Drew now,\" Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, said of Mr. Richter. \"He's running against President Trump, too.\"Mr. Richter said he wasn't bothered by the N.R.C.C. snub. (\"The benefit I saw from Young Guns, other than a news release, was close to zero,\" he said.) But even a rookie like him could understand that his apparent new distance from the president was less than ideal, especially in a district where Mr. Trump is incredibly popular among Republican voters.To exist in the Republican Party today is to be defined, more than anything else, by one's relationship with the president -- and to accept that political survival often means maintaining it. Which is probably why, even as Mr. Richter dutifully proclaimed his commitment to seeing the race through, he quietly signaled his openness to an exit route.In mid-December, as rumors circulated that Mr. Van Drew was planning to switch parties, Mr. Richter reached out to contacts in Mr. Trump's orbit including Bill Stepien, a Trump campaign official and New Jersey native. Mr. Stepien, as well as two others who spoke with Mr. Richter and requested anonymity to share private conversations, said Mr. Richter had stated his intention to stay in the race but would consider dropping out and running in the Third Congressional District instead if he were promised financial support, the president's endorsement and a public request to jump into the other race. One of the people who spoke to Mr. Richter said he was still waiting to hear the White House's response to his offer.Mr. Richter recalls those exchanges differently. \"I have had several conversations with people close to the White House, and that topic did come up, but I did not initiate it,\" he said. \"I also stated clearly that I did not have an interest in changing districts and I intended to continue pursuing the Republican nomination in the Second District. But I did say that if the White House or the Trump campaign wanted to have a dialogue with me about anything, I was willing to engage in a dialogue.\"Ms. Conway said the White House hopes Mr. Richter will consider other ways to help the party. \"We want Mr. Richter to remain engaged and be included,\" she said. \"There are many ways to contribute short of running for Congress.\"In some ways, Mr. Richter and the Trump world have been at odds from the beginning. It was Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, and Mr. Stepien who helped orchestrate Mr. Van Drew's party switch. They began laying the groundwork in late October after Mr. Van Drew voted against formalizing the impeachment inquiry, one of just two Democrats to do so.The nudge Mr. Van Drew needed came from his own polling, which showed support among Democratic voters in his district cratering if he ultimately voted against impeaching the president. Ms. Conway, who is also from South Jersey, was one of his first calls. On the night of Dec. 12, he told Ms. Conway, who was standing next to Mr. Christie at the time, that he was ready to pull the trigger. The plan was finalized in the White House residence the next morning: Mr. Van Drew would break with the Democrats on impeachment and join the president shortly after to announce his new affiliation.Mr. Richter, for his part, remains careful to temper his criticism of the White House, and to clarify that he understands why Mr. Trump made the decision he did, and to say that he doesn't fault him for it. He credits the ordeal as yet another byproduct of \"the swamp,\" a tale of what happens when leaders like Mr. Van Drew are no longer \"loyal to their principles.\"Asked if he believes Mr. Trump has stayed loyal to his principles, Mr. Richter paused. \"No comment,\" he said, then backtracked. \"And I don't want 'no comment' to be my answer. No answer.\"On the topic of Mr. Van Drew, Mr. Richter is much more forthright. \"I've talked to a lot of voters in the last month ... and I can tell you, overwhelmingly and not by a close margin, they're not ready to back Jeff Van Drew,\" he said.Of course there will be those who simply follow the president's lead, he noted. \"But I think most people probably have a wait-and-see attitude, which is, 'Well, he's got to prove to me that he's really Republican now, and this just wasn't done opportunistically,' which I don't think he's going to be able to prove, because that's exactly what this is,\" Mr. Richter said.Ron Filan, Mr. Van Drew's campaign manager, said in a statement, \"If David has any question as to Congressman Van Drew's relationship with the voters of South Jersey, I'd invite David to sign up for a ticket and see the response Jeff Van Drew gets when President Trump comes to support him in Wildwood later this month.\"Mr. Richter is doing what any textbook would probably advise at a moment like this: Drum up one's lifelong Republican bona fides. Remind voters of all the times the other guy stood with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Stay optimistic that Republicans in this district \"care about the issues\" and \"the principles they believe in.\"But this is not a textbook time.At a gathering of local Republicans at a Margate City restaurant this week, Mr. Richter introduced James Toto, a Somers Point councilman who was among the first officials to endorse him.Mr. Toto should say he's still all in for Mr. Richter. That Mr. Van Drew's switch meant nothing, that of course he'd love to oblige the president, but that he already pledged his support elsewhere.But after Mr. Richter walked away, Mr. Toto, leaning against the bar, admitted he was no longer so sure.\"I support our president. And this is what the president wishes,\" he said of voting for Mr. Van Drew.Mr. Toto then clutched his chest. \"How,\" he asked, \"do I go against what the president stands for?\"PhotographDavid Richter was leading until President Trump endorsed Jeff Van Drew, a former Democrat.

Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, wrote about his time in the White House.The firsthand account of the link between the aid and investigations, which is based on meetings and conversations Mr. Bolton had with Mr. Trump, undercuts a key component of the president's impeachment defense: that the decision to freeze the aid was independent from his requests that Ukraine announce politically motivated investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter.In their opening arguments on Saturday in Mr. Trump's trial, the president's lawyers asserted that Mr. Trump had legitimate concerns about corruption in Ukraine and whether other countries were offering enough help for its war against Russian-backed separatists, which his lawyers said explained his reluctance to release the aid. They also said that Democrats had no direct evidence of the quid pro quo they allege at the heart of their impeachment case.Multiple people described Mr. Bolton's account. A draft of the manuscript, which offers a glimpse into how Mr. Bolton might testify in the trial if he were called to, was sent to the White House in recent weeks for a standard review process.Here are five takeaways.Mr. Trump tied his willingness to release aid to Ukraine on investigations he sought.During a conversation in August with Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolton mentioned his concern over the delay of the $391 million in congressionally appropriated assistance to Ukraine as a deadline neared to send the money.Mr. Trump replied that he preferred sending no assistance to Ukraine until officials had turned over all materials they had about the Russia investigation related to Mr. Biden and supporters of Hillary Clinton in Ukraine, referencing unfounded theories and other assertions that Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, had promoted about any Ukrainian efforts to damage Mr. Trump politically.The president often hits at multiple opponents in his harangues, and he frequently lumps together the law enforcement officials who investigated his campaign's ties to Russia with Democrats and other perceived enemies, as he appeared to do with Mr. Bolton.Mr. Trump was at odds with his senior national security officials.According to Mr. Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper joined him in pressing Mr. Trump to release the aid in the weeks leading up to the August meeting.Mr. Trump repeatedly set aside their overtures by mentioning assorted grievances he had about Ukraine, some related to efforts by some Ukrainians who backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and others related to conspiracies and unsupported accusations about, among other things, a hacked server at the Democratic National Committee.Mr. Bolton says he talked to Barr and Pompeo about Giuliani.Mr. Bolton wrote that Mr. Pompeo privately acknowledged to him last spring that Mr. Giuliani's claims about Marie L. Yovanovitch, then the American ambassador to Ukraine, had no basis, including allegations that she was bad-mouthing Mr. Trump. Mr. Pompeo suggested to Mr. Bolton that Mr. Giuliani may have wanted Ms. Yovanovitch out because she might have been targeting his business clients in her anti-corruption efforts. Yet Mr. Pompeo still went through with Mr. Trump's order to recall Ms. Yovanovitch last May.Mr. Pompeo lashed out at a National Public Radio host on Friday and Saturday after she asked him in an interview about Ms. Yovanovitch's removal.Mr. Bolton also wrote that he had concerns about Mr. Giuliani. He said he warned White House lawyers last year that Mr. Giuliani might have been using his work representing the president as leverage to help his private clients.Among other names Mr. Bolton referenced in the manuscript: Attorney General William P. Barr. Mr. Bolton wrote that he raised concerns with Mr. Barr about Mr. Giuliani's influence on the president after Mr. Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine's president. That call was a critical piece of the whistle-blower complaint that prompted the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Barr on Sunday denied Mr. Bolton's account through a spokeswoman.Mr. Bolton is willing to testify. The White House doesn't want him to.Mr. Bolton, who released a statement this month saying he would appear at Mr. Trump's trial if he is subpoenaed, is prepared to testify before the Senate, according to his associates. He believes that he has relevant insight to present before senators vote on whether to remove Mr. Trump. He is also concerned, his associates said, that if his account of Mr. Trump's Ukraine dealings comes out after the trial, he will be accused of withholding potentially incriminating material in order to increase his book sales.Mr. Trump and the White House, however, do not want Mr. Bolton to appear.The White House had already ordered Mr. Bolton and other key officials not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. The manuscript has intensified concern among advisers that they need to use a restraining order to block Mr. Bolton from testifying, according to two people familiar with their concerns. It was unclear whether they would be successful in doing so.The manuscript introduced a significant twist to the impeachment trial.The revelations from the draft of Mr. Bolton's book could complicate the impeachment trial. A handful of moderate Republican senators who have signaled an openness to calling witnesses did not appear persuaded by the case that the Democratic House managers made last week at the trial, which The Times reported on Friday was heading as early as this week toward a vote on Mr. Trump's acquittal.Mr. Bolton's revelations could unearth support among that group and a handful of other senators who have indicated they might be open to hearing from him. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee said Friday he planned to wait until after Mr. Trump's lawyers presented and after senators asked the lawyers questions to decide on whether to support new testimony and evidence.At least one senator who will vote on impeachment was mentioned by name in the draft of the book: Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin. Mr. Bolton said Mr. Johnson was at a meeting last May with Mr. Trump in which the president railed about Ukraine trying to damage him politically.If the Senate does vote to hear from Mr. Bolton, the trial could stretch deep into February.PhotographRudolph W.

Sitting with her 14-year-old son, Lorenzo, she pumped her fists as Mr. Trump's voice rose and fell. She waved her made-for-TV sign -- \"Women for Trump\" -- and jeered along with the crowd when the president ran down the list of his villains: Democrats, Nancy Pelosi, the news media, Nancy Pelosi again. Mostly, she was having fun.The rally last month was just like any of over 500 that Mr. Trump has hosted since announcing his candidacy in 2015, but this one was special to Ms. D'Angelo because it was her first. When she emerged from the rally, her cheeks were flushed.\"That,\" she said, \"was a release.\"For the campaign, it was a capture.Ms. D'Angelo's experience represents the ideal outcome for a campaign that leads the way in using digital platforms to bring followers into the flock and hoovering up crucial voter information once they get there. Rallies like this one -- and an upcoming one Friday night in North Charleston, S.C. -- turn out to be the crown jewels of data collection for Mr. Trump's campaign.Step one: The data/ticket exchangeCampaign officials are open about viewing the rallies as data-mining expeditions that can help create a red-hatted army of volunteers.Ms. D'Angelo and her son, according to the campaign, were two of nearly 100,000 people who registered to attend the New Jersey rally, Mr. Trump's first in the state as president. To register for the rally, she visited the campaign site, clicked a button, then turned over her name, email address and phone number. She received two tickets in return.Ms. D'Angelo heard about the president's appearance through a friend who helps her operate a pro-Trump Facebook page she created before the 2018 midterm elections. Like most Facebook groups that support Mr. Trump, hers is a cascade of links to conservative websites, Trump White House social media posts and doctored photos of the president's enemies, including Ms. Pelosi.For Ms. D'Angelo, hearing the president talk was validation of her decision to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016. Watching his performance over the past three years -- particularly, she said, in securing America from \"illegal immigrants\" -- she has gone from someone who was raised politically independent to someone who now says she believes that the truth is to be trusted only if it comes from Mr. Trump.\"I was on the fence like anybody else,\" she said. But now, \"it's like a leap of faith for me knowing he's trying to do the right thing.\"Her digital ticket request was just a drop in the campaign data collection bucket. According to a tweet by Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign manager who publicly shares data after each rally, the Wildwood event had 158,632 requested tickets. Of the 73,482 voters identified by the campaign as seeking tickets, 10 percent did not vote in 2016 and more than a quarter had at one point been registered as Democrats. That last figure has campaign officials convinced that Mr. Trump is attracting people who are disillusioned with the current slate of presidential candidates, so the campaign cross-references the data it collects from rallies with voter information collected by the Republican National Committee.\"When someone signs up to go to a rally, we can match them up to our big voter file,\" said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign's communications director. \"From that we can tell if they've voted recently, if they're a Republican or Democrat, did they move from a different state. When we can identify someone as a supporter, that improves all of our modeling and voter scoring.\"Republican strategists say those numbers reveal that the Trump campaign is focusing not just on drawing in believers, but also on making sure they turn out to vote in November.\"People can be vocal Republicans online and in person but never vote,\" Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist, said in an interview. \"Voters are not necessarily rational actors, and that's why it's critical for the campaign to build a one-to-one relationship with them.\"Step two: Share views (and personal data)During the 90 minutes or so that Mr. Trump is onstage at every rally, he delivers what his campaign sees as its best product: a president who reinforces a feeling that the news media and the Democratic Party refuse to see anything positive about his administration or his supporters.As she waited in line in Wildwood, Ms. D'Angelo was approached by a Bikers for Trump member who was volunteering to collect names, addresses and phone numbers from people in the crowd on behalf of the New Jersey Republican Party. (Ms. D'Angelo told him she had already signed up.) She groused with an acquaintance, James Toto, a local councilman who is running for Atlantic County freeholder, over L.G.B.T.-friendly bathroom policies in public schools.Ms. D'Angelo also took time to check in on her pro-Trump Facebook page, sometimes broadcasting live video for others back home. Many of its members once worked in law enforcement, as did Ms. D'Angelo, an Army veteran who is retired from the police force in Paterson, N.J. She now collects a pension that she supplements with an auto body business she runs with her husband in Brigantine, N.J.At Mr. Trump's rallies and campaign events, his words are fine-tuned to appeal to white, Christian, blue-collar voters. Ms. D'Angelo, who is white, said his overtures to the military and law enforcement communities helped win her over. She cannot understand why anyone would dislike Mr. Trump, a leader who, as she puts it, \"has cojones.\"\"The last time I experienced such a patriotic push was 9/11,\" Ms. D'Angelo said. \"Apple pie. Baseball. Christmas. He really embodies the traditions we hold so dear.\"Christmas, as Ms. D'Angelo mentioned, is something Mr. Trump often mentions at his rallies. He claims that he alone made it safe to say \"Merry Christmas\" again. A \"Make America Great Again\" collectible ornament costs $60.Ms. D'Angelo likens staying updated on pro-Trump news on Facebook to another full-time job. She and other supporters who look at such pages are nearly certain to encounter the countless ads the Trump campaign has used to flood the platform. Facebook's fact-checking rules do not apply to political ads, letting candidates spread false or misleading claims.\"It usually stays with current events,\" Ms. D'Angelo said of her own page, \"and it's giving people a voice who can speak without retaliation.\"Finding friendly faces nearly everywhere in the crowd, Ms. D'Angelo complained with a stranger about the rough deal Mr. Trump got by inheriting the Obama-era national deficit. When a reporter pointed out that the president had actually helped widen the national debt -- despite a campaign-trail pledge to erase it within eight years -- she said that Mr. Trump had come into the job with a lot on his plate.\"The thing is he's also straightened things out,\" Ms. D'Angelo said in the president's defense.As she spoke, a message came on the Jumbotron asking Trump supporters to text their phone number to the campaign to stay in touch.The campaign has aggressively pushed text sign-ups across its digital platforms in order to create a direct relationship with individual supporters to ask them for small donations. The tactic has long been used by political campaigns -- 12 years ago, the Obama campaign was praised for its leveraging of SMS texting, by offering special merchandise and targeting voters in specific areas with news about rallies and events.But Teddy Goff, the Obama campaign's former digital director, said the Trump campaign had taken traditional digital tactics in a new direction by spreading misinformation and news of the president's latest political skirmish -- basically, keeping supporters angry enough to vote.The campaign's messaging approach often warns of what might happen should a Democrat win the 2020 election. \"If Radical Democratic candidates take back the Nation, they'll ruin everything President Trump has accomplished,\" one recent email sent to supporters read, before asking them to contribute money.\"I think the Trump campaign probably makes its people feel like they're being well served in that he validates all of their grievances,\" Mr. Goff said.Ms. D'Angelo said her news diet included Twitter, Facebook and news sites like the BBC and CNN -- though later she added that \"I can't turn it on\" -- and Fox News. Occasionally, she checks in on QAnon, the conspiracy website that has a noticeable presence at Trump rallies, to see what people are saying, but she views it more as entertainment.Ultimately, Ms. D'Angelo said, she takes bits and pieces from a variety of websites, crafting her own view of the news, but only believes it if it is confirmed by the president.\"I tune into the president every day, Fox every night,\" Ms. D'Angelo said. \"At night it's me and my husband. Fox comes on and we get up to speed.\"Step three: Just add moneyAfter making it inside the Wildwoods Convention Center, Ms. D'Angelo almost immediately encountered a table laden with Trump merchandise. With $100, she bought T-shirts, bumper stickers and hats, before turning around and spending $70 more on gifts for her brother. Along with her American Express card, she also handed over her driver's license, which was scanned and put into a database for campaign contributions.The Trump campaign is adept at rolling out new lines of merchandise, sometimes tailoring it to the latest social media outrage. Most of the merchandise requests are routed through a company called Ace Specialties in Lafayette, La., whose owner, Christl Mahfouz, can often be seen mingling with fans outside Trump rallies.Her team sells hats in exchange for money and the buyer's voting data: Each time supporters buy a T-shirt or a hat at a rally, a digital interface prompts them to turn over their names, addresses and other voter-specific information. This data is then logged as a donation to the Trump Make America Great Again Committee and each person's contribution is saved for future Federal Election Commission reports, according to a campaign official.For Ms. D'Angelo, her purchases would serve another function: Wearing them would give her pro-Trump protective armor after she left the bubble of the rally for the outside world.\"There's a whole army behind him,\" Ms. D'Angelo said. \"Even in New Jersey.\"Roughly 10 hours after she arrived in Wildwood, the president took the stage and launched into his familiar call-and-responses, reserving special treatment for Democrats, whom he called \"do nothing\" and \"crazy. Eventually, he landed on the news media.\"Do you see the fakers back there?\" Mr. Trump said, pointing to reporters and camera people in a roped-off area. \"Fake news.\"The president also spent time hammering home a key message: that he and his family have sacrificed a life of luxury for him to be president. Ms. D'Angelo heard that message loud and clear.\"Sometimes he looks so tired and I go, 'Ugh, look at him,\"' Ms. D'Angelo said. \"He's going through so much abuse to protect us. I know he's strong. I know he can take it. But compliment the man sometimes. I don't see anything he's done wrong.\"By the time she left, the hours and money Ms. D'Angelo had spent in Wildwood ended up solidifying her bond with a campaign -- and a president -- who has prioritized his ability to connect with his supporters on an emotional level. And after the rally, she knew her marching orders.\"We need to do everything to get him re-elected,\" she said, \"is what we're going to do.\"PhotographSettling in at Wildwoods Convention Center in Wildwood, N.J., last month for one of President Trump's campaign-style rallies.

But Mr. Sessions was barely fending off a strong challenge from a political upstart, Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn University football coach who clung closely to Mr. Trump in a relentlessly negative and personal campaign that turned the race into a contest of who was more loyal to the president. He will now face Mr. Sessions in a March 31 runoff.A third Republican, Bradley Byrne, a congressman from the Mobile area who tried to overcome his long association with the Republican Party establishment by also tethering himself to Mr. Trump, conceded defeat on Tuesday night.Voters in Alabama, Texas and North Carolina, where Democrats on Tuesday picked a candidate to challenge a vulnerable Republican, Senator Thom Tillis, were setting up the bigger battle for control of the Senate in 2020. Cal Cunningham, an Army veteran and former state legislator, won the Democratic nod to run against Mr. Tillis in what is expected to be one of the country's most fiercely contested Senate races.The winner on the Republican side in Alabama will face Senator Doug Jones, who is widely viewed as the most endangered Democrat up for re-election in the Senate this year. Whoever wins the Republican nomination is expected to have a significant advantage over Mr. Jones in deeply red Alabama, which Mr. Trump carried with 61 percent of the vote.Speaking to a sparsely attended gathering of supporters on Tuesday night in a hotel banquet room in Mobile, Mr. Sessions emphasized his pro-Trump credentials -- reminding them he was the first senator to endorse the president in 2016 -- and vowed to be the strongest advocate for the president's policies in Washington.\"Anyone can say they are for the Trump agenda, but talk is cheap,\" he said. \"I have fought on the great issues of our day, and I have won.\"If Republicans do win the seat, it will provide them some breathing room in what is expected to be an otherwise difficult year to defend their 53-47 majority, with a polarizing president on the ticket and concern that Republican senators from Maine to Colorado are in jeopardy. With the vice president empowered to cast tiebreaking votes in the Senate, Democrats need a net gain of three seats to take the majority if the party captures the White House; four if not.The primary in Alabama was a humbling experience for Mr. Sessions, who was treated as a castoff by the Republican Party he helped transform by championing a more nationalistic, anti-immigration, anti-free trade agenda years before Mr. Trump ran for office sounding those themes. Mr. Sessions's predicament became a cautionary tale about the grudges and grievances that are at the heart of Mr. Trump's politics. And it left little doubt about how successful Mr. Trump has been at turning his party into a vessel for his own political advancement, where the fundamental organizing principle is not conservative ideology or policy, but personal loyalty to him.Mr. Sessions's failure to make a stronger showing on Tuesday was a striking reversal of fortune for a politician whose standing in Alabama was once so formidable that the last time he ran for re-election in Alabama, the Democratic Party did not even bother to nominate a candidate to oppose him.His problem this time was that not enough Republican voters appeared to recall the pre-Trump Jeff Sessions, a beloved figure on the right who helped fuel a populist backlash that antagonized Republican leaders over the very issues that are now at the heart of Mr. Trump's nationalist agenda.Instead, many of them saw the diminished attorney general who had been harangued, humiliated and belittled by Mr. Trump, who attacked Mr. Sessions as \"scared stiff\" and \"Missing in Action\" and told NBC News that appointing him was his \"biggest mistake\" he had made as president.Mr. Trump's low opinion of Mr. Sessions aside, the race was shaped by other factors that did not work in his favor. Mr. Tuberville, who emphasized his lack of experience in politics, called for Alabama to turn the page and elect fresh leadership. Mr. Sessions, who is 73, can no longer claim to be the renegade outsider he once was.And that appears to have left an impression on voters who are wary of anyone they associate with Washington.\"Jeff will have to emphasize that he can go to work and help the president on Day 1, and that the Senate isn't a place for on-the-job training,\" said Jim Zeigler, the Alabama state auditor and a Republican. Mr. Tuberville, by contrast, will have the outsider's advantage. \"In a runoff, if Coach Tuberville can sell the idea, 'I am not a politician, I am an outsider,' he'll be very strong,\" Mr. Zeigler added.Probably helping Mr. Sessions hang on was the fact that Mr. Trump largely stayed silent once Mr. Sessions announced his campaign -- an uncharacteristic show of restraint for a president who can rarely resist the urge to dive into races across the country, and can change their outcome with a single caustic tweet. His advisers and Republican leaders pleaded with him not to interfere in the Alabama race even though his hostility toward his former attorney general still burns hot.But that restraint may not hold between now and the runoff. Given Mr. Sessions's lackluster showing on Tuesday, Mr. Tuberville's allies are expected to push the White House to endorse him over Mr. Sessions. That could further damage Mr. Sessions given how much influence the president's word can have in Republican primaries.More often when voters turn away from a politician with a long record and a reservoir of good will, legal or ethical wrongdoing or a personal scandal has left them sour. In Mr. Sessions's case, the opposite was true. Legal scholars and Justice Department lawyers agreed that he properly recused himself from overseeing the investigation into possible ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign because he had been a close adviser to Mr. Trump during the election. Mr. Trump fired him in November 2018 and Mr. Sessions stayed largely quiet, until announcing his Senate campaign almost exactly one year later.In the eyes of Mr. Trump and his supporters -- and the campaign message of Mr. Sessions's primary opponents -- the former attorney general's offense was that he had not done enough to protect the president. The ethics of the recusal, as far as they were concerned, were either irrelevant or misrepresented by enemies of the president.Even before Mr. Sessions announced that he would run, the primary was dominated by effusive demonstrations of support for Mr. Trump. The candidates rarely saw an issue they did not try to use as a way to prove their fealty to the president. As the House of Representatives prepared to impeach the president in October, Mr. Byrne was one of several Republicans who barged into a closed Intelligence Committee meeting and started shouting at Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman and a leader of the Democratic impeachment effort.Mr. Tuberville campaigned across the state saying that his biggest reason for wanting to serve in Washington was \"to help Donald Trump.\" In his first television ad, he declared that the president was a gift from the divine. \"God sent us Donald Trump because God knew we were in trouble,\" he says, promising to go to Washington to help build the Trump border wall and drain the proverbial swamp.A fourth Republican candidate, Roy S. Moore, was on track to finish a distant fourth place. The nomination of Mr. Moore, a former judge who was accused of forcing himself on teenage girls, set into motion the series of events that led to Mr. Jones's improbable victory. No Democrat had been elected to the Senate from Alabama in a generation.Mr. Sessions's assumption going into the race was that his decades of service in Alabama -- he was first elected to the Senate in 1996 and served as state attorney general for two years before that -- would help him overcome any stain on his reputation from his falling out with the president. On the campaign trail, he played the role of the seasoned pragmatist who would defend the Trump agenda because he understood and valued it better than anyone.He also tried to remind Alabamians that despite his troubled relationship with the president, he had been an early supporter of Mr. Trump's when \"only one senator had the guts to support him,\" as one of Mr. Sessions's recent ads put it.In North Carolina, Mr. Cunningham, a moderate favored by party leaders in Washington, was on track to handily beat Erica D. Smith, a Democratic state senator running to his left in the primary. But the victory did not come cheaply: His campaign and outside Democratic groups spent more than $10 million boosting his candidacy. And in a sign of how concerned Republicans are about losing the seat, they quietly funneled close to $3 million into the race on Ms. Smith's behalf to make Mr. Cunningham's path more difficult.In Texas, M.J. Hegar, a former Air Force helicopter pilot, advanced to a Democratic primary runoff for the chance to challenge Republican Senator John Cornyn.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographHis Republican rivals portrayed Jeff Sessions, left, as insufficiently loyal to President Trump.

Bloomberg's presidential campaign has secured 60 seconds' worth of advertising during the game on Feb. 2. President Trump's re-election campaign announced it had done the same.Michael R. Bloomberg's presidential campaign has secured a 60-second advertising spot to air nationally during next month's Super Bowl telecast, an ad buy that will most likely cost at least $10 million.Hours after The New York Times reported Mr. Bloomberg's plans, President Trump's re-election campaign said that it, too, had reserved 60 seconds' worth of advertising during the game for roughly $10 million.The dueling ads on the year's biggest night of television are evidence that the two New York billionaires are preparing for a schoolyard brawl on the national airwaves over the coming months, with each increasingly willing to dip into his vast resources -- Mr. Bloomberg is spending his own fortune, and Mr. Trump has a nine-figure campaign war chest -- to broadcast their messages.\"The biggest point is getting under Trump's skin,\" said Michael Frazier, a spokesman for the Bloomberg campaign. By \"taking the fight to Trump,\" Mr. Frazier said, \"the ad is part of Mike's strategy of running a national campaign that focuses on states where the general election will be decided, parts of the country that are often overlooked.\"Aides to Mr. Bloomberg, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said his Super Bowl ad would be a new spot that has not yet aired. They would not specify the cost of the ad, but executives at Fox, which is broadcasting the game on Feb. 2, have said they were seeking \"north of $5 million\" per 30-second spot.The Trump campaign's decision to advertise during the Super Bowl, which was first reported by Politico, continues a strategy of advertising during major sporting events.\"President Trump made the unprecedented decision to keep the campaign open following his first election, which allows us to do things like buying a Super Bowl ad,\" said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign. \"We got in early, which gave us prime ad position early in the game.\"It was not clear when during the game Mr. Bloomberg's ad would air. The Super Bowl is regularly the most watched single television program in any given year; last year's game drew 98.2 million viewers on CBS.Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has continued to set records for political advertising by a presidential candidate, having already spent nearly $170 million on television and digital advertising, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire media owner and former mayor of New York, is funding his campaign with his own money and is not soliciting donations.\"We have the means to raise a national campaign unlike any other candidate,\" Mr. Frazier said.Mr. Bloomberg has made targeting Mr. Trump a core element of his ad strategy. Before he announced his candidacy, he pledged to spend $100 million on ads criticizing the president. And since he began his bid, his campaign has unloaded a barrage of Facebook attack ads in general-election swing states, seeking to erode support for Mr. Trump by highlighting what Mr. Bloomberg calls his broken promises on infrastructure, health care and solving dysfunction in Washington.Super Bowl ads are rarely seen in presidential politics. Though some campaigns have made local advertising buys during past Super Bowls, a national buy has often been out of reach, given the expense. It is also usually viewed as wasteful to pay to reach a 50-state audience rather than buying ads in key states where campaigns would prefer to target their message.But Mr. Bloomberg is running an unconventional primary campaign with a heavy national emphasis, choosing to avoid the four states that hold the first caucuses and primaries in February and instead focusing his efforts on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 states will vote.\"It's actually smart for Bloomberg,\" said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco. \"Bloomberg is running a national campaign, and the most efficient way to reach a lot of people in a national campaign is buying an ad in a top-rated show. And as expensive as it is, it's cheaper than buying the ads market by market.\"Mr. Trump's campaign also has deep pockets. It said last week that it had raised $46 million in the last three months of 2019 and was entering 2020 with $102.7 million in cash on hand.The Super Bowl ads will air at a politically potent time: The Iowa caucuses are the day after the game (though Mr. Bloomberg has said he is not competing in them), and Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address the night after that.The Super Bowl broadcast has often avoided the rancor of national politics. Perhaps the most recent national advertisement that waded into political territory was a 30-second ad featuring Tim Tebow, then a recent college football star, talking about his anti-abortion views, which aired during the 2010 matchup between the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts.Presidential campaigns have advertised during major sporting events before, however. In October, the Trump campaign made a seven-figure ad buy during Game 7 of the World Series, pushing back on the impeachment inquiry in Washington. And in 2016, with just over a week to go before Election Day, Mr. Trump's and Hillary Clinton's campaigns each purchased multiple ads during Game 7 of that year's World Series.PhotographMichael R.

At this point, the president has one clear option for how to proceed politically, and is hoping that an array of factors will break his way.The option, which he has brazenly pushed in recent days, is to cast himself as a \"wartime president\" who looks in charge of a nation under siege while his likely Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., is largely out of sight hunkered down in Delaware. This gambit, however, requires a rewriting of history -- Mr. Trump's muted approach to the virus early on -- and it's far from clear if many voters will accept the idea of him as a wartime leader.Then there are other variables that he and his allies hope will fall in their favor: that the outbreak of the virus will slow and, in the warmer months, dissipate; that the states will get it under control; that the federal government's steps taken so far will flatten the curve; that Mr. Biden and the Democrats will look impotent and inconsequential by comparison; and that enough voters will move past his initial efforts to play down the virus's dangers.The great unknown, of course -- and the tremendous risk to Mr. Trump's political fate, no matter what he says or does -- is that the human cost, the economic toll, and the longevity and course of the pandemic are all X factors that will most likely play out for months and could be strongly salient if not severe by the time of the November general election.In perhaps the best-case scenario for Mr. Trump, the patina of a \"wartime president\" could prove to be influential with casual voters who don't dig into the details of his belated response to the coronavirus, which included dismissing the criticism of his handling of the threat as a Democratic \"hoax\" and contributing to a slow start in testing for the virus.\"He is counting on people being so traumatized on a day-to-day basis that they will forget his inaction,\" said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. \"It's better for him to be a wartime commander in chief than someone who, when the big crisis hit, misread it completely.\"Politically, Mr. Brinkley said, the new posture made sense. \"He can claim credit for the curve flattening at some point,\" he said, \"and hope people will be afraid to push a leader out of office if the crisis pushes into the fall.\"The president's course correction showed some quick results that were seized on by his political advisers. An ABC News poll released last week showed that 55 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Trump's response to the pandemic, up from 43 percent the week before.Rarely have incumbent presidents seen their arguments for re-election evaporate so quickly. Mr. Trump and his advisers had planned to argue that the strong economy warranted a second term and that supporters and detractors alike wanted their 401(k)'s in the Trump-era stock market; that has now become an impossible sell. And as the administration negotiates an enormous bailout package with Congress for multiple industries, his strategy of caricaturing Democrats as \"socialists\" is not tenable either.So Mr. Trump is trying to mount a new version of his old argument: that \"I alone can fix it,\" as he said at the 2016 Republican convention about the nation's problems. He is counting on enough voters believing they have to stick by a leader in the midst of an immense global crisis.Addressing fearful Americans, Mr. Trump said on Sunday evening: \"You have a leader that will always fight for you and I will not stop until we win. This is going to be a victory.\" He added at another point, \"No American is alone as long as we're united.\"But shortly after reading his new script on Sunday night, Mr. Trump mocked Senator Mitt Romney of Utah for self-quarantining. \"Romney's in isolation? Gee, that's too bad,\" he said sarcastically at the briefing room podium.Mr. Trump is on uncertain political ground. His poll numbers in critical swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan have been wavering, with most surveys showing him behind Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Republican officials are banking on voters seeing him as take-charge in contrast to Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, who have been following the government's guidance about staying indoors but have not yet found memorable ways to show how they would lead in this crisis.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have held news conferences from remote locations, and Mr. Biden has participated in \"virtual\" fund-raisers. While Mr. Biden has an all but insurmountable lead in the race for the Democratic nomination, he has no real ability to steer events because he is not officially the presumptive nominee, and therefore is not the head of the party either.As a result, Mr. Biden finds himself with far fewer options than Mr. Trump or Democratic governors like Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who have real authority and are holding news conferences often broadcast live.In turn, Republican officials and Sanders allies are pushing out attacks on Mr. Biden's low profile, asking \"Where's Joe?\" in emails to supporters and the news media. (A spokesman, T.J. Ducklo, said Sunday that Mr. Biden had not been tested for the virus because he had shown no symptoms.)But the \"wartime\" strategy also presents risks to Mr. Trump. In his new posture, he is trying to rewrite recent history, erasing his comments from as recently as a week ago when he told Americans that they needed to \"just relax\" because \"it all will pass.\" It is also undercut by his resistance to calls for additional federal action from governors in hard-hit states.Mr. Trump's temperament is also dissimilar to \"wartime presidents\" with whom he is seeking to compare himself. Over the course of his presidency, Mr. Trump has struggled to stick to any bipartisan message, or speak emotionally to the pain and fear of Americans during crisis points like natural disasters or mass shootings.\"That's why it's so hard to be a wartime president,\" said Michael Beschloss, the historian and author of \"Presidents of War.\" \"Not only are you coming up with a strategy and tactics, but at the same time you have to let Americans know that you know how hard this is for them.\"Mr. Trump, so far, has struggled to feel anyone's pain, unlike past presidents, while continuing to play out the fights with the news media that enliven his base. Last week, he lashed out at a journalist who had prompted him to explain what his message was to the millions of Americans watching him from home, who felt scared.The president has also continued to credit his own administration's response. But Mr. Beschloss added that \"part of being a wartime president is being willing to give people bad news,\" a job Mr. Trump has mostly left to others.At the same time, he has been timid of using wartime powers to fight what he has called an \"invisible enemy.\" Last week, for instance, he resisted invoking the Defense Production Act, a federal law that grants presidents extraordinary powers to force American industries to ensure the availability of critical equipment.Mr. Trump's allies are aware that his re-election now hangs almost entirely on how he handles the crisis. And the question is whether he will be seen as President George W. Bush was in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when he was widely viewed as bringing the nation together, or if he will be compared to Mr. Bush amid the fallout from Hurricane Katrina, when he tried to minimize a crisis that eventually became too big for him to ignore, and during which Mr. Bush praised cabinet officials even as the federal government bungled the response.Aides said that how Mr. Trump ends up being perceived would also depend on Mr. Trump's own disposition during the crisis. It is not clear to them whether he will be able to maintain his focus on the crisis for months, especially as the economic situation worsens. Over the weekend, some Trump advisers weren't ready to accept the likelihood of jobless claims climbing into the millions by next month.The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, defended Mr. Trump's response as apolitical. \"While it seems many in the media continue to use every opportunity to destroy this president, the fact remains that he has risen to fight this crisis by taking aggressive historic action to protect the health, wealth and well-being of the American people,\" Ms. Grisham said in an email.Some Democrats, meanwhile, said the mistakes made at the beginning of the response had already colored how Mr. Trump would be remembered both in the history books and at the ballot box in November. \"At the end of the day, this will be Katrina with the waters at a much higher level, and lasting a longer time,\" said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.But there is an emerging split in Democratic circles about whether to attack Mr. Trump's response to the virus in real time, or whether the gravity of the moment calls for a pause in negative political advertising and attacks.Some of Mr. Trump's highest-profile political adversaries leading states that have become epicenters of the virus have been striking conciliatory notes as they seek federal assistance. Mr. Cuomo said the president was \"fully engaged\" on the crisis. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democrat of California, described a recent phone conversation with Mr. Trump as \"a privilege.\"Other antagonists have continued to criticize him. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York tapped into one of Mr. Trump's greatest fears when he referred to him on CNN as the \"Herbert Hoover of his generation,\" comparing him to a president who failed to recognize or take bold actions to stave off the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression.The debate about whether to embrace or attack Mr. Trump in a national emergency played out most succinctly on Twitter between David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the two men who led Barack Obama's presidential campaigns.Mr. Axelrod said that voters would have plenty of time to judge Mr. Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis, \"but now doesn't seem the moment for negative ads.\" Mr. Plouffe responded that time was of the essence, and that Democrats couldn't afford to \"disarm\" and let Mr. Trump create his own reality.Veterans of John Kerry's 2004 campaign said Mr. Biden was in a stronger position against Mr. Trump than they were when they faced an election against Mr. Bush. Back then, Mr. Bush still basked in good will from his performance in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.Some Democratic Party officials said a comparison between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump at a moment of crisis only helped Mr. Biden.\"You can see the contrast between the steady, assured, informed and strong leadership that Vice President Biden has shown and the bungling, chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr. Trump has shown us since the beginning of this crisis,\" said Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump spoke on Saturday during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.

On any given day it serves \"M.A.G.A. Subs\" and \"Liberty Bell Lasagna.\" The \"Second Amendment\" pizza comes \"loaded\" with pepperoni and sausage. The dining room is covered in regalia praising President Trump.But this October morning was \"Trumpstock,\" a small festival celebrating the president. The speakers included the local Republican congressman, Paul Gosar, and lesser-known conservative personalities. There was a fringe 2020 Senate candidate in Arizona who ran a website that published sexually explicit photos of women without their consent; a pro-Trump rapper whose lyrics include a racist slur aimed at Barack Obama; and a North Carolina activist who once said of Muslims, \"I will kill every one of them before they get to me.\"All were welcome, except liberals.\"They label us white nationalists, or white supremacists,\" volunteered Guy Taiho Decker, who drove from California to attend the event. A right-wing protester, he has previously been arrested on charges of making terrorist threats.\"There's no such thing as a white supremacist, just like there's no such thing as a unicorn,\" Mr. Decker said. \"We're patriots.\"As Mr. Trump's bid for re-election shifts into higher gear, his campaign hopes to recapture voters who drifted away from the party in 2018 and 2019: independents who embraced moderate Democratic candidates, suburban women tired of Mr. Trump's personal conduct and working-class voters who haven't benefited from his economic policies.But if any group remains singularly loyal to Mr. Trump, it is the small but impassioned number of white voters on the far right, often in rural communities like Golden Valley, who extol him as a cultural champion reclaiming the country from undeserving outsiders.These voters don't passively tolerate Mr. Trump's \"build a wall\" message or his ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries -- they're what motivates them. They see themselves in his fear-based identity politics, bolstered by conspiratorial rhetoric about caravans of immigrants and Democratic \"coups.\"The president draws support from a broader political and ideological cross-section of Republicans than the Trumpstock crowd reflected, and he attracts some independents and Democrats as well. The festival itself was relatively small, drawing about 100 people, though significant enough to attract the likes of Mr. Gosar.But events like it, as well as speaking engagements featuring far-right supporters of the president, have become part of the political landscape during the Trump era. Islamophobic taunts can be heard at his rallies. Hate speech and conspiracy theories are staples of some far-right websites. If Trumpstock was modest in size, it stood out as a sign of extremist public support for a sitting president.And these supporters have electoral muscle in key areas: Mr. Trump outperformed Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, in rural parts of Arizona like Mohave County, where Golden Valley is located. Mr. Trump won 58,282 votes in the county, compared to 47,901 for Mr. Romney, though Mr. Romney carried the state by a much bigger vote margin.Arizona will be a key battleground state in 2020: Democrats already flipped a Senate seat and a Tucson-based congressional district from red to blue in 2018. For Mr. Trump, big turnout from white voters in areas like Mohave County -- and in rural parts of other battlegrounds like Florida, Michigan, Minnesota and Georgia -- could be a lifeline in a tight election.\"We like to call this the 'Red Wall of Arizona,\"' said Laurence Schiff, a psychiatrist and Republican campaign official in Mohave County who organizes in support of Mr. Trump's campaign. \"Winning the state starts here, with us.\"Grass-roots gatherings play a critical role in the modern culture of political organizing, firing up ardent supporters and cementing new ones. Small circles of Trump-supporting conservatives, often organized online and outside the traditional Republican Party apparatus, engage in more decentralized -- and explicit -- versions of the chest-beating that happens at Mr. Trump's closely watched political rallies.In interviews, people in the crowd described a white America under threat as racial minorities typified by Mr. Obama, the country's first black president, gain political power. They described Mr. Trump as an inspirational figure who is undoing Mr. Obama's legacy and beating back the perceived threat of Muslim and Latino immigrants, whom they denounced in prejudiced terms.\"I don't have a problem with Muslims,\" said Angus Smith, an Arizona resident who attended the festival, \"but can they take the rag off their head out of respect for our country?\"At Mr. Trump's official rallies, including a recent one in Florida, the president has referred to Mr. Obama by stressing his middle name, Hussein, and said Democrats were \"trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you.\"The Trumpstock speakers pushed even further, tying Mr. Obama's middle name to a false belief that he is a foreign-born Muslim.And Democrats were portrayed as not just political opponents, but avatars of doom for Mr. Trump's predominantly white voter base and for the country.\"There is no difference between the democratic socialists and the National Socialists,\" said Evan Sayet, a conservative writer who spoke at the event, referencing Nazi Germany. Democrats, he said, \"are the heirs to Adolf Hitler.\"A Republican Party shaped in Trump's imageSpeakers at Trumpstock said their cultural fears had been exacerbated by their state's own changing nature: Arizona is on the front lines of undocumented border crossings from Mexico and racial minorities are expected to outnumber white people in the state in the next decade.Arizona Democrats made political gains in 2018, and the national party is riding high after it won governor's races this year in Kentucky and Louisiana. But Republicans remain bullish. They argue that a slice of their electoral base will only vote when the president is on the ballot, and point to regions like Northern Arizona as places to find, as Mr. Trump wrote in a recent tweet, \"the Angry Majority.\"\"We have the greatest base in the history of politics,\" he said at a recent rally in Florida.In Arizona, the most prominent pro-Trump, anti-immigrant groups are AZ Patriots and Patriot Movement AZ, which have held tight to the themes of white nationalism that some Republicans have denounced. In September, after repeated clashes, some members of the groups agreed to a court order to stop harassing migrants and church volunteers who help them.Earlier this year, the groups and their allies organized a \"Patriotism over Socialism\" event in Gilbert, Ariz., near Phoenix, that included speeches from Representative Andy Biggs, the area's congressman, and Kelli Ward, the state's Republican Party chair. They appeared alongside more fringe figures: Sharon Slater of Family Watch International, which has promoted figures associated with anti-L.G.B.T. conversion therapy, and Laura Loomer, the far-right activist and Arizona native who was banned by Twitter and some other platforms after making anti-Muslim comments.This blend of insider and outsider, of mainstream and conspiracy, is a feature of how Mr. Trump has reshaped the Republican Party in his image, and the core of his presidential origin story. Before Mr. Trump announced any firm plans to seek office, he was the national face of the \"birther\" conspiracy, which thrived in the Tea Party movement and had a significant amount of support from the Republican base, polls showed.Stacey Goodman, a former police officer from New York who retired to Arizona and attended Trumpstock, said her distrust of Mr. Obama's birth certificate had led her to Mr. Trump.\"If you're Muslim, just tell us you're Muslim,\" she said of Mr. Obama. \"It's not that I didn't believe him, I'm just not qualified to answer that question. I've seen information on both sides that's compelling.\"Mona Fishman, a singer from the Las Vegas area who performed at the event, has written Trump-themed songs with titles like \"Fake News\" and \"Smells like Soros,\" which accuses liberal megadonor George Soros of running a shadow government, a trope widely condemned as anti-Semitic.In the White House, Mr. Trump has relied on similar unfounded conspiracy theories and promoted people who have perpetuated them. He pardoned Joseph M. Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, a hero of Arizona's right wing and a leader of the \"birther\" movement, who was convicted of criminal contempt related to his aggressive efforts to detain undocumented immigrants.On Mr. Trump's Twitter account, likely the most watched in the world, he has promoted white nationalists, anti-Muslim bigots, and believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, which claims that top Democrats are worshiping the Devil and engaging in child sex trafficking.Even mainstream conservative media figures have embraced QAnon as a way to dismiss Mr. Trump's political enemies. The Fox News host Jesse Watters, during a recent segment dedicated to the conspiracy, linked it to Mr. Trump's Washington enemies. \"Isn't it also about the Trump fight with the deep state in terms of the illegal surveillance of the campaign, the inside hit jobs that he's sustained?\" he asked.The embrace of conspiracy theories has frustrated some establishment Republicans and moderate Republican voters, who urge Mr. Trump to embrace a more traditional communication style.His base disagrees.\"Please never stop tweeting,\" Ms. Fishman sings in one of her songs, titled \"Thank You President Trump.\" \"I can hardly wait to see what I'll be reading.\"'I don't believe in violence, but...'Events like Trumpstock are not limited to Arizona. Its organizer, Laurie Bezick, recruited speakers from around the country through social media, tapping into a network of pro-Trump voices only a click away.Long-shot congressional candidates touting an \"America First\" agenda came from places like Iowa and Maryland. Leaders of fledgling political groups with names like JEXIT: Jews Exit The Democratic Party, Latinos for Trump and Deplorable Pride, a right-wing L.G.B.T. organization, told the overwhelmingly white audience they were not anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, homophobic or racist. In fact, the speakers insisted, people who used those terms were more guilty of bigotry than the people they accused.To applause, the co-founder of Latinos for Trump, Marco Gutierrez, read the pledge he took when he became a naturalized citizen and renounced his Mexican homeland. Nitemare, a pro-Trump rapper who refused to give his legal name, invoked QAnon and called Mr. Obama a racist slur in his set.Brian Talbert, the founder of Deplorable Pride, was contacted by the White House after he was barred from the L.G.B.T. pride parade in Charlotte, N.C. At Trumpstock, Mr. Talbert, who has a history of expressing anti-Muslim beliefs on social media, gave voice to hatred of Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and Mr. Trump's 2016 opponent.\"I think she should be hanging at the end of a rope for treason,\" he said of Mrs. Clinton.Members of groups like these at once make up a critical portion of Arizona's conservative base, and espouse derogatory rhetoric that must repeatedly be repudiated, creating political difficulties for the state's Republican lawmakers. After a photograph emerged last April of members of Patriot Movement AZ posing with Gov. Doug Ducey, he said he had never heard of the group. \"I absolutely denounce their behavior,\" he added.Trumpstock attendees say they are used to being denounced, another quality they feel they share with the president. It's part of why they are protective of him, to the point that they refuse to acknowledge the possibility of a Trump loss in 2020.Mark Villalta said he had been stockpiling firearms, in case Mr. Trump's re-election is not successful.\"Nothing less than a civil war would happen,\" Mr. Villalta said, his right hand reaching for a holstered handgun. \"I don't believe in violence, but I'll do what I got to do.\"PhotographAttendees at an Arizona Trump festival viewed the president as their champion in a cultural fight.

He has named judges with records on a range of issues important to Republicans -- and to his re-election.As a Republican candidate for the Texas Supreme Court, Don R. Willett flaunted his uncompromising conservatism, boasting of endorsements from groups with \"pro-life, pro-faith, pro-family\" credentials.\"I intend to build such a fiercely conservative record on the court that I will be unconfirmable for any future federal judicial post -- and proudly so,\" a Republican rival quoted him telling party leaders.Judge Willett served a dozen years on the Texas bench. But rather than disqualifying him, his record there propelled him to the very job he had deemed beyond reach. President Trump nominated him to a federal appeals court, and Republicans in the Senate narrowly confirmed him on a party-line vote.As Mr. Trump seeks re-election, his rightward overhaul of the federal judiciary -- in particular, the highly influential appeals courts -- has been invoked as one of his most enduring accomplishments. While individual nominees have drawn scrutiny, The New York Times conducted a deep examination of all 51 new appellate judges to obtain a collective portrait of the Trump-populated bench.The review shows that the Trump class of appellate judges, much like the president himself, breaks significantly with the norms set by his Democratic and Republican predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush.The lifetime appointees -- who make up more than a quarter of the entire appellate bench -- were more openly engaged in causes important to Republicans, such as opposition to gay marriage and to government funding for abortion.They more typically held a political post in the federal government and donated money to political candidates and causes. Just four had no discernible political activity in their past, and several were confirmed in spite of an unfavorable rating from the American Bar Association -- the first time that had happened at the appellate level in decades.Two-thirds are white men, and as a group, they are much younger than the Obama and Bush appointees.Once on the bench, the Trump appointees have stood out from their fellow judges, according to an analysis by The Times of more than 10,000 published decisions and dissents through December.When ruling on cases, they have been notably more likely than other Republican appointees to disagree with peers selected by Democratic presidents, and more likely to agree with those Republican appointees, suggesting they are more consistently conservative. Among the dozen or so judges that most fit the pattern, The Times found, are three Mr. Trump has signaled were on his Supreme Court shortlist.While the appellate courts favor consensus and disagreement remains relatively rare -- there were 125 instances when a Trump appointee wrote the majority opinion or dissent in a split decision -- the new judges have ruled on disputed cases across a range of contentious issues, including abortion, immigration, L.G.B.T. rights and lobbying requirements, the examination shows.One new judge, who had held a political job in the Trump administration, dissented on an issue of particular importance to the president: disclosure of his financial records. The judge, Neomi Rao, opposed a decision requiring the release of the documents to a congressional committee, a mandate the president continues to resist and is now before the Supreme Court.\"They have long records of standing up, and they're not afraid of being unpopular,\" said Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy group that has pushed for the mold-breaking appointments. Ms. Severino once served as a law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the Supreme Court's most reliably conservative members.Stephen B. Burbank, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Trump's appointments reflected attempts by recent presidents to draw the federal judiciary -- a constitutionally independent branch of government -- into policy debates more appropriate in Congress and the White House.\"The problem as I see it is not that judges differ ideologically -- of course they do -- nor is it that a Republican president would look for someone with congenial ideological preferences,\" Mr. Burbank said. \"It's that in recent decades the search has been for hard-wired ideologues because they're reliable policy agents.\"Mr. Trump has appointed more judges to the appeals courts, where eight of the nine current Supreme Court Justices served, than any other president during the first three years in office. Also known as circuits, the 13 courts are the last stop for federal cases before the Supreme Court, and nearly all federal litigation ends there.The Times examination was based on interviews with dozens of people close to the nomination process, including some of Mr. Trump's appointees; the analysis of thousands of published decisions and dissents since Mr. Trump became president; a review of detailed biographical and financial questionnaires submitted by all 168 appellate judges named by Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, as well as their records, public statements and campaign contributions since 1989.Judicial appointments, a standard measure of a president's legacy, almost always draw partisan scrutiny, as Republicans tend to appoint conservative lawyers who interpret the Constitution according to what they say was its original meaning, and Democrats lean toward liberal appointees with a more expansive view. But Mr. Trump's record is particularly striking because of the divisive atmosphere, the examination shows, and the president's disruptive approach to governing. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and none of the judges contacted by The Times would agree to be quoted.When Mr. Trump took office there were 103 unfilled federal court openings, in addition to a Supreme Court seat, in part because Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader of the Senate, and allies had refused to proceed with confirming many of Mr. Obama's nominees. The last time so many vacancies had been left to a successor of the opposing party was when the federal bench was expanded by dozens of judges under President George H.W. Bush.Mr. Trump wasted no time in seizing the opportunity. During his first three years in office, with Mr. McConnell's assistance, he was able to name nearly as many appellate judges as Mr. Obama had appointed over two terms.And he did so with great political flourish. More than one-third of the Trump appointees have filled seats previously occupied by judges appointed by Democrats, tipping the balance toward conservatives in some circuits that include largely Democratic states like New York and Connecticut. Even in the San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit, a reliably liberal appeals court, Mr. Trump has significantly narrowed the gap between judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents.With Republicans and Democrats in Congress retreating to their corners, many of the Trump appointees have benefited from Republicans' decision to extend a contentious and partisan confirmation path that upended bipartisan Senate practices.Two-thirds of the new appellate judges failed to win the support of 60 senators, historically a requirement of consensus that was first jettisoned by the Democratic-controlled Senate midway through the Obama administration because Republicans were blocking nominees to the D.C. Circuit. After he became majority leader, Mr. McConnell followed suit when Democrats initially blocked Mr. Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.About a third did not receive the signoff of both home-state senators, a courtesy for a nomination to move forward that was tossed aside in late 2017 by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, then the Judiciary Committee's Republican chairman. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Grassley's successor in that role, carried the decision forward. Crucially, that meant Mr. Trump did not have to compromise on his appellate picks in states with a Democratic senator.Just two found unanimous support across the aisle, a sharp drop from both the Obama and Bush nominees.According to a tally by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group, Mr. Trump's appointees across the judiciary have drawn three times more \"no\" votes in the Senate than all confirmed judges in the 20th century combined. So far, Mr. Trump has appointed more than 185 federal judges.On the appellate bench, Mr. Trump's appointees have drawn nearly twice as many \"no\" votes as did those of Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, The Times's analysis shows.In a history-making intervention, one of Mr. Trump's appellate picks was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence broke a 50-50 deadlock. It was Mr. Pence's 12th tiebreaking vote in the Senate, the most of anyone in his office since the 1870s, and the only time a vice president installed a nominee to the bench.The judge, Jonathan A. Kobes, had been working on Capitol Hill as an aide to a Republican senator. He was rated unqualified by the American Bar Association, which questioned his ability to reflect \"complex legal analysis\" and \"knowledge of the law\" in his writing.He got the job anyway, with Mr. Grassley proclaiming on Twitter in December 2018 that the confirmation had \"made HISTORY.\" Judge Kobes became Mr. Trump's 30th confirmed appointee to the appellate bench.Democrats, powerless to block the nominees, have been sidelined as angry bystanders.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called Mr. Trump's appellate appointees \"far outside the judicial mainstream,\" adding that she believed Republicans were using them to advance \"a particular agenda.\" She voted against all but 14 of the appellate nominees.\"Americans are certainly aware of Supreme Court nominations,\" Ms. Feinstein said in a statement to The Times, \"but most don't pay close attention to the lower courts, which can have an even more direct effect on their lives.\"From Fringe to MainstreamMr. Trump has staked his presidency on upending conventions, and his approach to the judiciary breaks sharply with that of past presidents.He unapologetically views judges as agents of the presidents who appointed them -- calling out an \"Obama judge,\" for instance, for ruling against the Trump administration in an immigration case. He frequently attributes his popularity among Republicans to his judicial appointments. And he has not been shy about politicizing the process.\"95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party,\" he wrote on Twitter in January. \"Thank you! 191 Federal Judges (a record), and two Supreme Court Justices, approved. Best Economy & Employment Numbers EVER. Thank you to our great New, Smart and Nimble REPUBLICAN PARTY. Join now, it's where people want to be!\"In his State of the Union address in February, he bragged about his judicial appointments, promising, \"We have many in the pipeline.\" A week later, the Senate approved his 51st nominee to the appeals bench; 41 others now await votes for the lower courts.While federal judges of all stripes take an oath of impartiality and reject the notion that they do a president's bidding -- Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. recently described an independent judiciary as \"a key source of national unity and stability\" -- the examination by The Times shows that the Trump administration has filled the appellate courts with formidable allies who fought for a range of issues important to Republicans.Democratic presidents have also sought out reliable political allies when filling some judicial posts, but Mr. Trump's approach has left little to chance.His appointees include former litigators who argued against legalizing same-sex marriage; advocated blocking Medicaid reimbursements to health care providers performing abortions; argued that corporations with religious owners could not be required to pay for insurance coverage of certain forms of birth control; and supported the Trump administration's choice to include a question about citizenship on the census.In the past, many conservatives have been left disappointed when judges appointed by Republican presidents were seen to have lost their resolve on the bench. Now what matters most with Mr. Trump's appointees, said Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, is that they come with rock-solid conservative résumés.\"You have to demand a paper trail -- no more skeleton nominees,\" said Mr. Blackman, who advised the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican, and is a strong supporter of the Trump approach.One standout appointee, Kyle Duncan, now an appellate judge in New Orleans, fought to uphold Louisiana's gay-marriage ban before the Supreme Court, defended a North Carolina law restricting transgender people from using their preferred bathrooms and represented Hobby Lobby when it sued the federal government over the requirement that it provide employees with insurance coverage for some birth control.He had worked as general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal advocacy group that has been a strong defender of the religious right.Responding to questions from senators about the North Carolina law, he said he had been \"advancing not my own personal beliefs but legal arguments on behalf of my client's interests, just as I have done in every case to the best of my ability.\"Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee to the federal appeals court in Philadelphia, last September emphasized the independence of judges once they took the bench, saying, \"We certainly are not viewing ourselves as members of teams or camps or parties.\"Many of the appointees have elite credentials, with nearly half having trained as lawyers at Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago or Yale, and more than a third having clerked for a Supreme Court justice, surpassing the appointees of both Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush.But Mr. Trump's appellate picks often have less judicial experience, The Times found. About 40 percent previously served as a judge, compared with more than half of the Bush and Obama appointees.Mr. Trump named some of his judges before they received a rating from the American Bar Association, which Republicans have long viewed as biased against their nominees. Three deemed unqualified were confirmed -- a step not taken at the appellate level since at least 1975, when a former governor of Connecticut nominated by former Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford joined the bench, according to Sheldon Goldman, a political scientist focusing on the judiciary.Mr. Trump is betting that the judges will back Republican priorities for a long time: The median age of the appointees is five-and-a-half years younger than it was under Mr. Obama, and three-and-a-half years younger than under Mr. Bush. Thirty-three percent were under 45 when appointed, compared with just five percent under Mr. Obama and 19 percent under Mr. Bush. And countering a trend of increasing diversity on the appellate bench under Mr. Obama, two-thirds of Mr. Trump's appointees are white men.They are also well off: Their median net worth is nearly $2 million -- adjusted for inflation, that is on a par with the worth of Obama appointees, and about a half-million dollars more than that of Bush appointees.Perhaps most telling, all but eight of the new judges have had ties to the Federalist Society, a legal group that has been central to the White House's appointment process and ascendant in Republican circles in recent years for its advocacy of strictly interpreting the Constitution.Nearly twice as many appointees have had ties to the group as did those of Mr. Trump's most recent Republican predecessor, Mr. Bush. Early this year, a proposal was circulated among federal judges by the court system's ethical advisory arm that would ban membership in the group.The Trump appointees turned out in big numbers at its national convention in Washington in November. Many participated in panel discussions and attended a black-tie dinner, where Donald F. McGahn II, a former White House counsel for Mr. Trump, extolled the group's extraordinary trajectory.\"We have seen our views go from the fringe, views that in years past would inhibit someone's chances to be considered for the federal bench,\" he said, \"to being the center of the conversation.\"Battle-Tested ConservativesJudge Willett, the former Texas Supreme Court justice, had a paper trail replete with political connections and ties to prominent Texas Republicans when he was nominated to the federal bench in 2017.He had raised over $4 million for two campaigns for the state bench, more than half of it from lawyers, lobbyists and oil interests, according to the National Institute on Money in Politics. He also had more than 25,000 posts on Twitter that often focused on current affairs and Republican politics, even some jabbing Mr. Trump as a candidate.During the last Republican administration, under Mr. Bush, he had advised judicial nominees \"to bob and weave, be the teeniest tiniest target you can be,\" Judge Willett said during a speech in 2010, adding, \"You want to be as bland, forgettable and unremarkable as possible.\"No more. The Trump approach has translated into a new breed of appellate appointees with open experience in ideological and political warfare.John Malcolm, a conservative legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, said he was looking for \"people who have the strength of their convictions.\" He drew up a list in 2016 of recommended Supreme Court nominees that was embraced by Mr. Trump.About three-quarters of Mr. Trump's appellate appointees donated to political candidates and causes, a significantly higher proportion than Mr. Obama's and slightly ahead of Mr. Bush's, according to an analysis of data from the National Institute on Money in Politics and the Center for Responsive Politics.They were also more likely than the Obama and Bush nominees to have been affiliated with an election campaign in the decade before their appointment.Judge Duncan, previously a renowned conservative litigator, had volunteered for the 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and was a donor and poll watcher for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid.At least seven of his fellow appointees had ties to the Trump administration itself. Judge Rao had run a regulatory office in the White House. Judges Steven J. Menashi and Gregory G. Katsas had worked in the office of the White House counsel. Judge Patrick J. Bumatay had been a counselor to the attorney general, while Judge Lawrence J.C. VanDyke had been tapped for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division. Judges Katsas and Andrew L. Brasher had volunteered for Mr. Trump's transition team. And Judge Chad A. Readler had done legal work for Mr. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.He later became acting head of the Justice Department's civil division, putting him in charge of defending nearly every high-profile presidential policy that came under attack in the courts.Judge L. Steven Grasz, in the year he was nominated to the appeals court in Nebraska, had sat on the board of the anti-abortion Nebraska Family Alliance and served as assistant secretary of Nebraskans for the Death Penalty.Other appointees had held state jobs that showcased their conservative -- and sometimes partisan -- credentials.Nearly a quarter of them worked in the office of a Republican state attorney general. That was about triple the percentage of Bush nominees, The Times found. Mostly, they served as solicitors general or their deputies, putting them on the front lines in court battles over contentious state laws.At least eight actively fought against legalizing gay marriage, and at least as many argued for immigration positions now embraced by the Trump administration. At least 18 sought to limit access to abortion or contraception.Some nominees amassed their conservative credentials by filing friend-of-the-court briefs, weighing in on cases especially important to Republicans.Judge VanDyke, appointed to the Ninth Circuit in Nevada, had been prolific. As solicitor general of Montana, according to published emails, he encouraged the state's attorney general to support a 20-week abortion ban in Arizona, to defend a professional photographer's refusal to shoot a same-sex commitment ceremony in New Mexico and to challenge a ban on semiautomatic weapons in New York.The fact that Montana was not directly affected by the cases did not matter. In an email to the solicitor general in Alabama -- who would also be named to the appellate bench by Mr. Trump -- he wrote about the New York ban: \"Semiautomatic firearms are fun to hunt elk with, as the attached picture attests :).\" The Great Falls Tribune, which obtained the emails, published a photo of the now-judge in hunting garb.Judge Michael H. Park, another appointee, had come to the support of the Trump administration in its unsuccessful effort to add a citizenship question to the census. As a private lawyer representing the Project on Fair Representation, a conservative group, he argued in 2018 that the question was justified, calling it \"immensely helpful to redistricting and voting rights litigation.\"The Supreme Court disagreed. Four months after he weighed in, it was announced that Mr. Trump intended to nominate him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York.'Judicial Courage'Some of Mr. Trump's choices for the appeals courts had already landed on his short list for Supreme Court nominations. Once on the bench, they quickly confirmed that they could shake things up.Three on that short list -- Judges Joan Larsen, David R. Stras and Amul Thapar -- were among those identified by The Times as having a penchant for disagreeing with Democratic nominees. They voted differently from those judges 23 percent of the time, but from judges appointed by Republican presidents only four percent of the time.Judge Larsen and Judge Stras had been state supreme court justices named by Republican governors in their home states. Judge Thapar was elevated by Mr. Trump from a federal district court in Kentucky, where he had been appointed by Mr. Bush.Unlike lower courts, the appellate courts, which review other courts' decisions, do not have juries. Instead, cases are largely decided by panels of three judges, usually selected randomly from all of the judges in the circuit.There is a culture of consensus in most circuits, and in the cases reviewed by The Times, appellate judges of both parties agreed with one another the vast majority of times. But when they did not, the Trump appointees stood out.On panels that had members appointed by presidents of the same party, dissent occurred just 7 percent of the time. The rate jumped to 12 percent on panels that included a mix of judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans.But when a Trump appointee wrote an opinion for a panel with a lone Democrat, or served as the only Republican appointee, the dissent rate rose to 17 percent -- meaning the likelihood of dissent was nearly 1.5 times higher if a Trump appointee was involved.Writing a dissent marks a bold break from fellow members of the bench, experts say, and by definition sets the judge apart. The dissenting opinions can also inform future legal arguments and cases.\"You're going to get some judges who will bite their tongue and say, 'These are my colleagues -- I'm not going to rock the boat unless I feel strongly about it,\"' said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education arm of the federal court system.In other instances, however, judges \"go in slashing and burning\" with no regard for comity -- or with an eye to drawing attention to themselves, he said. \"Some of them obviously are going to be thinking about the next vacancy on the Supreme Court,\" Mr. Wheeler said.In a speech in 2017, Mr. McGahn, the former White House counsel and a main driver of the Trump selection process, said \"judicial courage\" was as important as judicial independence.The Times analysis included 10,025 opinions of three-judge panels from 2017 through 2019 that were tagged as \"published, written and signed\" in the federal center's integrated case database.It covered more than 1,975 cases involving at least one Trump appointee. Because many of Mr. Trump's earliest appointments occurred in appellate courts dominated by judges named by Republicans, more than half of those cases did not involve panels with judges appointed by a Democrat.Of the 125 cases in which a Trump appointee wrote a dissent or an opinion eliciting dissent, about half involved civil rights or criminal matters. The others touched on a wide variety of topics, from transgender rights to pregnancy discrimination to the limits of police powers.In one instance, a Trump appointee joined with a Bush appointee to strike down a key part of the Affordable Care Act. A Democratic-nominated judge dissented.Amy Coney Barrett, another judge on Mr. Trump's Supreme Court shortlist, was among the new appointees who wrote a dissent cited by conservatives.Judge Barrett, a noted originalist, once served as a clerk to former Justice Antonin Scalia. But she stood out among the Trump appointees not by disagreeing with Democratic appointees but by taking on two judges named by former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.The subject was Second Amendment gun rights, and Ms. Barrett took a broader view than her colleagues.The owner of a therapeutic shoe-insert company had pleaded guilty to mail fraud and, as a felon, was barred from owning a gun. He objected, claiming the penalty was unconstitutional.The two Reagan appointees upheld a lower-court ruling against the man. Their decision was based in part on the notion that governments banned felons from owning firearms because they were considered more likely to abuse them.But in dissenting, Judge Barrett argued that lawmakers could prohibit only violent people from owning firearms, and that the government had not proved that a nonviolent felon would turn violent.\"History does not support the proposition that felons lose their Second Amendment rights solely because of their status as felons,\" she wrote.A dissent by another new appointee, Judge Rao, the former Trump administration official, staked out territory important to the president and his allies.Two appellate judges, both appointed by Democrats, ruled that Mr. Trump's accountants had to comply with a congressional subpoena for eight years of his financial records.Judge Rao, who holds the appellate seat vacated by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, questioned whether Democrats in the House of Representatives had overshot their authority. At a hearing on the case, she suggested the Democrats were, in effect, seeking the \"regulation of the president.\"In her 67-page dissent, she wrote that the subpoena went beyond Congress's authority, and that the documents in question could be obtained only in an impeachment inquiry.She also chided her fellow judges for allowing Congress to conduct \"a roving inquisition over a co-equal branch of government,\" suggesting they had chosen to fixate on worst-case scenarios.The case has been appealed to the Supreme Court, where two Trump appointees, Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch, will help determine its fate.Tipping the BalanceThe push in the Senate last November to confirm a White House lawyer for a top federal judgeship in New York unnerved Democrats.The lawyer, Steven Menashi had a trail of inflammatory writings about feminism and multiculturalism. He had declined to answer specific questions about his role in the Trump administration on family detentions and education policy.And he had managed to get a confirmation vote only because Republicans did away with a courtesy rule letting home-state senators -- in this case, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer -- block nominees they found unworthy. Mr. Schumer had described him as \"a textbook example of someone who does not deserve to sit on the federal bench.\"Not only did he get his seat on the Second Circuit, but his appointment marked a signature moment in Mr. Trump's bid to tilt the nation's appellate courts to the right: Judge Menashi's confirmation flipped the balance toward Republican appointees in a circuit encompassing three states -- New York, Connecticut and Vermont -- dominated at nearly every level by Democrats.Judges named by Mr. Trump have forged new majorities in two other circuits -- the Third and the 11th. And they have come close in the nation's largest appeals court, the Ninth, based in San Francisco, which has long issued rulings favorable to liberal causes.The unequal split between Democratic and Republican appointees can give the circuits distinct reputations as liberal or conservative.Mr. Trump has called the Ninth Circuit \"out of control\" and a \"complete & total disaster,\" and he has suggested that some of its decisions related to immigration and the border have threatened national security.In one case, the court ruled that the Trump administration could not erase Obama-era protections for so-called Dreamers, children brought into the United States illegally.In another, it blocked the administration's effort to speed up the deportation of asylum seekers. It also rejected Mr. Trump's policy restricting travel from eight countries, six of them largely Muslim.\"Every case that gets filed in the Ninth Circuit, we get beaten,\" Mr. Trump complained in 2018. \"It's a disgrace.\"At the close of the Obama administration, 18 judges on the circuit had been appointed by Democratic presidents, seven had been named by Republicans and four seats were vacant. Through his appointments, Mr. Trump has whittled the majority held by Democratic appointees to just three making it less likely that a liberal philosophy can dominate so thoroughly.Allies of the president have celebrated. In emails to supporters, the National Organization for Marriage, a group established to fight the legalization of same-sex marriage, lauded the change \"from the most liberal court in the country to one that is much more balanced.\"Brian S. Brown, president of the group, heralded that Mr. Trump was remaking the court and others across the country. \"Judges will be with us for a lot longer than any politician who holds office,\" he wrote.Conservatives have also celebrated Trump appointees in circuits where the balance of power has not shifted. Their votes have proved significant in so-called en-banc hearings -- when a decision by a panel of appellate judges is reviewed by a larger group of judges.In 2014, a Louisiana law required doctors performing abortions to be able to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of their clinic. Opponents of the law predicted a chilling effect on access to abortions. Those in favor argued that it protected women seeking abortions by making sure doctors were competent.The case, now being decided by the Supreme Court, has been playing out in federal courts for years. A district court judge struck down the law, but was reversed by a divided three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit. When opponents of the law asked all judges of the circuit to hear an appeal, the request was denied, 9-6, with four judges appointed by Mr. Trump joining the majority.At an en-banc hearing in Missouri, four Trump-appointed judges in the Eighth Circuit joined a 6-5 decision that loosened disclosure requirements for political activists.In the case, a man who ran a nonprofit advocating conservative causes had sued Missouri officials over a lobbying registration law he deemed unconstitutional. He was not a lobbyist, he argued, addressing lawmakers often but not spending or receiving money for it. A lower court and a three-judge appeals panel had sided with the state, requiring him to register out of transparency.Among the four Trump appointees who overturned that ruling were Judge Kobes, the former Senate aide who had been confirmed when Mr. Pence offered up a tiebreaking vote; Judge Stras, who was on Mr. Trump's shortlist for the Supreme Court; and Judge Grasz of Nebraska.As he seeks re-election, Mr. Trump has showcased his role in fulfilling the Republican ju,  he said.How the Numbers Were CalculatedIn examining the president's judicial appointments, Full TextTranslateUndo Translation FromToTranslateTranslation in progress... \n","\n","[[missing key: loadingAnimation]]The full text may take 40-120 seconds to translate; larger documents may take longer.\n","\n","Cancel\n","OverlayEndTurn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation\n","| Jump to first hitEfforts to bring wavering Republicans into line appeared to be working as President Trump's lawyers argued that anything a president did to win re-election was \"in the public interest.\"WASHINGTON -- The White House and Senate Republicans worked aggressively on Wednesday to discount damaging revelations from John R. Bolton and line up the votes to block new witnesses from testifying in President Trump's impeachment trial, in a push to bring the proceeding to a swift close.As the Senate opened a two-day, 16-hour period of questioning from senators, Mr. Trump laced into Mr. Bolton, his former national security adviser, whose unpublished manuscript contains an account that contradicts his impeachment defense. The president described Mr. Bolton on Twitter as a warmonger who had \"begged\" for his job, was fired, and then wrote \"a nasty & untrue book.\"On Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump's aides circulated a letter informing Mr. Bolton that the White House was moving to block publication of his forthcoming book, in which he wrote that the president refused to release military aid to Ukraine until its leaders committed to investigating his political rivals. That is a core element of the Democrats' case, which charges Mr. Trump with seeking to enlist a foreign government to help him win re-election this year.Before the trial convened, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and other Republicans signaled that they were regaining confidence that they would be able to cobble together the 51 votes needed to block new witnesses and documents and bring the trial to an acquittal verdict as soon as Friday, after the revelations from Mr. Bolton, reported Sunday by The New York Times, had threatened to knock their plans off course.Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican, declared that he had \"heard enough\" and predicted that the Senate would vote to acquit the president by week's end.\"I'm ready to vote on final judgment,\" Mr. Barrasso told reporters. Asked if Republicans planned to move directly to a vote on the two articles of impeachment on Friday, Mr. Barrasso said, \"Yes, that's the plan.\"By Wednesday afternoon, Democrats were sounding a note of pessimism about the prospect of witnesses and securing new evidence in the trial, even as they used their questions to make the case that an impeachment trial without additional witnesses and documents amounted to a cover-up.\"We've always known it will be an uphill fight on witnesses and documents because the president and Mitch McConnell put huge pressure on these folks,\" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said during a break in the trial.\"Is it more likely than not? Probably no,\" Mr. Schumer said. \"But is it a decent, good chance? Yes.\"For Republicans, it appeared as if they were on the verge of giving Mr. Trump what he has wanted all along: an acquittal that he could boast about on the campaign trail -- delivered before he goes to the Capitol next Tuesday for his State of the Union address.Inside the Senate chamber, senators spent eight hours grilling House managers and White House lawyers about the definition of obstruction; the meaning of executive privilege; the history of security aid to Ukraine; the role of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., on the board of a Ukrainian energy company; the whistle-blower who first raised concerns about Mr. Trump's call with the president of Ukraine; and whether, as Mr. Trump's legal team asserted, it was perfectly fine for the president to solicit damaging information about the Bidens from Ukraine.In accordance with impeachment protocol, senators wrote their queries on small cards, which were read aloud by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who presided over the trial. In their responses, Mr. Trump's lawyers offered their most expansive defense of the president to date, effectively arguing that a president cannot be removed from office for demanding political favors if he believes his re-election is in the national interest.\"Every public official I know believes that his election is in the public interest,\" said Alan M. Dershowitz, the celebrity defense lawyer and constitutional scholar who is part of the Mr. Trump's legal team. \"Mostly, you're right.\"\"If the president does something which he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,\" he said.Many of the arguments and much the day was tailored to convincing a few Republicans who remained holdouts on the question of whether to call witnesses. Mr. McConnell gave his party's first question on Wednesday to Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in an effort to allay the concerns of the three lawmakers, Republican moderates who are swing votes on the issue. The trio teamed up to ask Mr. Trump's lawyers how they should judge the president if they conclude he acted in the Ukraine matter with both political and policy motives.The selection of Ms. Collins, who is facing the toughest re-election campaign in her long Senate career, was revealing: It suggested that Mr. McConnell was keenly focused on giving her every opportunity to have her voice heard before moving forward. When she rose to announce herself, she became the first senator other than the two leaders to have a speaking role in the trial.Notably absent from the group was the fourth Republican who had expressed interest in witnesses: Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a close friend of Mr. McConnell's who has said he will not decide whether to support witnesses until after the question period has closed.Later in the evening, Mr. Romney hinted that he was seeking to better understand why Mr. Trump withheld security aid for Ukraine, asking White House lawyers for the specific date that the president first ordered a hold on the assistance. Patrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel, did not provide a direct answer, saying there was no evidence of a specific date and offering only testimony showing that budget officials were aware of the hold in late June.On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell had privately warned his rank-and-file members that he did not currently have the votes to stop Democrats from summoning witnesses. One after the other on Wednesday, in statements and interviews in the Capitol, they made clear they would side with their leader.Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, who had previously floated the idea of a witness deal, said Wednesday that he was \"very, very skeptical\" of new witnesses. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, facing a tough re-election in a swing state, issued a statement saying that he had heard enough and would vote against hearing from anyone else. Senator Martha McSally of Arizona, who is also facing a difficult election, tweeted later Wednesday: \"I have heard enough. It is time to vote.\"Mr. McConnell summoned Ms. Murkowski to his office on Wednesday morning for a private meeting before the trial began, and she emerged refusing to answer questions about whether she would ultimately support the call for witnesses.\"We still got some folks who are, like I said, assessing,\" said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Senate Republican. But the leaders were planning as if the defeat of a bid for witnesses was a certainty; Mr. Thune said it was likely that if it did fail, Republicans would move swiftly for an acquittal.Democrats would need the votes of four Republicans to compel the Senate to subpoena witnesses and new documents. But it seems increasingly likely that Mr. Alexander, who is retiring from the Senate and is thus free to do as he chooses without political repercussions, would not break from his party.Mr. Trump is charged with abusing his power and obstructing Congress by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden, and concealing evidence of it from lawmakers who were investigating.In the first hint of a possible crack in Democratic unity, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama suggested Wednesday that he might vote to acquit Mr. Trump on the charge of obstruction of Congress, though he said that the president's own behavior was strengthening the case against him. And Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia said he thought that Hunter Biden might be a relevant witness.\"I'm still looking at that very closely; there are some things that trouble me about it,\" Mr. Jones said, without elaborating. \"But I will tell you this about the obstruction charge: The more I see the president of the United States attacking witnesses, the stronger that case gets.\"Fielding friendly questions from Democratic senators, House managers reiterated the heart of their case and accused Mr. Trump's lawyers of falsely stating that there was no evidence that Mr. Trump linked security assistance to investigations. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead House impeachment manager, responded to Mr. Dershowitz's argument that a president who believed his re-election was in the national interest could demand a quid pro quo to help himself politically without consequence was \"very odd.\"\"If you say you can't hold a president accountable in an election year where they're trying to cheat in that election, then you are giving them carte blanche,\" Mr. Schiff said. \"All quid pro quos are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are corrupt.\"Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine was precisely the kind of corrupt scheme that the nation's founders had in mind when they created impeachment, fearing that an out-of-control president would abuse his power for personal gain. But throughout the day, lawyers for Mr. Trump argued that all elected officials make policy decisions to help themselves get re-elected.Answering the question from the three Republican moderates, Mr. Philbin said that a president could not be removed for a \"mixed-motive situation\" in which he is acting out of both personal and policy concerns.\"There's always some personal interest in the electoral outcome of policy decisions and there's nothing wrong with that,\" Mr. Philbin told senators. \"That's part of representative democracy.\"In one case, White House lawyers struggled to answer a question from Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski, admitting that they had no evidence to counter Democratic arguments that Mr. Trump became interested in investigations of Joseph Biden in 2019 only after Mr. Biden became a candidate for president.Mr. Trump's legal team also argued that the House needed to prove its case \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" -- a standard of proof that legal experts say has no basis in either the Constitution or the rules of the Senate. And the legal team said that the case was merely \"based on a policy difference\" between the president and the career diplomats who sounded the alarm on his pressure campaign in Ukraine.While Chief Justice Roberts spent the day reading senators' words aloud, he did exercise his judgment on one key point, refusing to reveal the identity of the C.I.A. whistle-blower who filed the complaint that spurred the impeachment inquiry. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, sought unsuccessfully to ask a question about the origins of the investigation that named the whistle-blower, according to a person familiar with the debate. The query was rejected repeatedly.White House lawyers had help making sure their speakers stayed within a five-minute time limit that Chief Justice Roberts strictly enforced, and he occasionally cut off speakers midsentence. Staff for the lawyers held up small white cue cards showing when the clock was about to run out; the Democratic House managers did not appear to have such a system.Reporting was contributed by Catie Edmondson, Nicholas Fandos, Patricia Mazzei and Emily Cochrane.PhotographSenator Mitt Romney of Utah before Wednesday's session.

Advisers hope to expand the electoral map for November by winning moderate-leaning states like Minnesota and New Hampshire. And the White House is gearing up to help with policy issues directed at swing states, such as the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada and paid family leave for federal workers.Trump campaign officials are also stockpiling cash to help with these efforts, with $200 million in the bank now and fund-raising continuing at a brisk pace. They have put up television ads relatively early in the race, allocating $6 million for the final three months of 2019 to highlight a booming economy and the low unemployment numbers.Among the goals is trying to appeal to black voters and suburban and upper-income white voters with ads such as a spot focusing on criminal justice reform that first aired during the Super Bowl and is continuing on cable channels with large female audiences, like Bravo and Lifetime.Yet Mr. Trump's messaging, like so much else about his approach to politics, is contradictory. For all the focus on appealing to moderates, the campaign is also engaging the president's hard-core supporters with Facebook ads warning of the danger of undocumented \"aliens\" and their \"invasion\" of the U.S., and decrying \"the impeachment hoax,\" while also promoting polarizing policies like curtailing immigration.Those inflammatory, targeted ads are ones that suburban voters may never see, a reflection of the campaign's broad strategy: Keep his conservative base energized and chip away at his problems in the suburbs and communities of color.The challenge facing Mr. Trump's advisers remains the same as it has been since 2017: The president is among the most deeply divisive leaders in the nation's history, whose conduct has helped accelerate a realignment of moderate suburban voters toward Democrats. These voters have been the cornerstone of Democrats' electoral revival since 2016, helping them flip governorships and propelling their capture of the House.Mr. Trump cannot win a second term without winning back suburban voters and independents in a handful of states he carried in 2016. But he is highly averse to staying on script and delivering a consistent message aimed at moderate voters rather than his hard-core admirers, or his own need to get things off his chest.Mr. Trump's advisers argue that the suburban voters who eschewed Republicans in the 2018 midterms will vote differently when the president's name is on the ballot. And they are lacing the strong economy into much of their messaging and policy plans: Mr. Trump himself sees the economy as his calling card and is monitoring fluctuations in stock market closely, and his team thinks the economy is one of their best selling points in the suburbs.\"Suburban women is where he has a challenge,\" said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican from North Dakota.\"I think the biggest problem that he has with suburban women is the part that so many in his base like about him,\" Mr. Cramer said. \"His rhetoric, his punching down at his opponents. It's so different than anything they've seen.\"Scott Reed, the top political adviser to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, nodded to the fleeting nature of Trump-era politics as he assessed the electoral landscape for the president.\"Politics in Trumpville are great right now, but these days, a week feels like three months and we have a long way to go,\" Mr. Reed said.Republican National Committee officials are tracking the suburban problem. In 2016, about 100,000 Michigan residents who voted in state legislative races left the box for president empty. Many of those voters were men in the suburbs, R.N.C. officials said, and were people who didn't believe Mr. Trump was truly a conservative, but who have come back after seeing him deliver on conservative judicial appointments and a tax-cut bill.But suburban women remain difficult to sway, Trump advisers acknowledge. Some messages have moved the dial, if only temporarily: When Mr. Trump talks about Democrats wanting to provide government health care benefits to undocumented immigrants, for instance, Republican officials have seen an uptick of support in their own surveys of the suburbs of Pennsylvania. When Mr. Trump paints the entire Democratic field, falsely, as supporting ending private health insurance, his advisers see room for him to grow. But they admit that it's a difficult line to walk.The G.O.P. strategy ultimately depends on who his Democratic opponent turns out to be. And Mr. Trump faces an unknown in Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire former New York City mayor running a general election strategy, who is spending so much money that Mr. Trump's advisers acknowledged that he cannot be ignored even if Mr. Bloomberg loses the Democratic nomination.With the Democrats enmeshed in the start of their primary season, Mr. Trump is beginning his own new phase: He has reasons to feel reassured about his prospects as he turns more fully to his re-election effort, and the apparatus of the White House and the Republican Party are more able to focus on winning him a second term.Mr. Trump's approval ratings have inched up and he's now around where the last three incumbent presidents were at the start of their own, successful, re-elections. And the economy shows no signs of slowing.\"The White House and the campaign should focus 100 percent on the economic growth and opportunity society Trump is creating for America,\" Mr. Reed said, somewhat hopefully.But greater confidence and a freer hand can lead Mr. Trump to take risks: His phone call with the Ukrainian president on July 25, 2019, which ultimately helped lead to his impeachment in the House, came after he had seen the end of the two-year investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Just this past week, Mr. Trump fired from the White House two witnesses and an ambassador who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, including Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated war veteran, prompting outrage from Democrats and private concern among some Republican lawmakers. On Saturday, he tweeted that Colonel Vindman had earned his dismissal.As Mr. Trump has repeatedly shown, he can show a measure of discipline in one moment -- like his teleprompter-ready speech at the State of the Union that was sprinkled with appeals to different demographic groups -- and then do or say something that alienates swing voters.His 62-minute stemwinder of retribution in the East Room of the White House the day after the acquittal was the type of ventilating performance Mr. Trump had been craving, but which some advisers acknowledge undermines the carefully-crafted efforts at broadening his appeal.\"Many people are evaluating the president based on his conduct and behavior in office rather than the state of the economy,\" said Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster. \"It's his conduct and behavior in office that have kept a foot on his job approval rating. Any other president would be in the upper 50s or even low 60s with this economy.\"Most of the president's aides concede that his base of supporters is not enough to re-elect him, and that he must attract the voters who were repelled by his behavior and voted against Republicans in the 2018 midterms -- particularly upscale whites, suburban women and self-described independent voters who polls repeatedly show think the president is racist, or has a troubling temperament, or both.To that end, the president's campaign aired a Super Bowl ad featuring Alice Johnson, a black woman convicted on charges related to drug trafficking whose sentence the president commuted. The president also awarded an \"Opportunity Zone\" scholarship to a young African-American girl during his State of the Union address, and tailored other moments during the speech to appeal to members of the military.Trump advisers are focused not just on the three states that elected Mr. Trump in 2016 -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- but also the forever battleground of Florida, and battleground states with competitive Senate races that could help the Democratic nominee in Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina.The campaign also sees opportunities for pickups in New Hampshire and especially in Minnesota, states that have voted for Democrats in recent presidential races but where the margins were close in 2016. But while the campaign manager Brad Parscale has insisted New Mexico is within reach, other Trump advisers say there's been little movement, in part because of the president's disinterest in taking the day trips he favors to the western part of the country.In an interview, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the R.N.C., said they have the resources to appeal to multiple groups of voters. \"That gives us an advantage to focus on the rural vote that we need to turn out, but then also go after places where we've lost voters to bring them back in,\" she said. And Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, said they had always planned to woo various demographics, \"regardless of what Democrats in Congress were trying to do to him.\"The administration is pulling out the policy stops. Vice President Mike Pence has recently made stops and bus tours in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, highlighting Trump administration efforts like the \"school choice\" initiative to help low-income students enter private schools.On Thursday, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was looking to move away from a proposal pushed by his former energy secretary, Rick Perry: storing nuclear waste in Nevada's Yucca Mountain, an effort his two top political advisers, Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, opposed for years. And officials are expected to hold events in the Midwest highlighting provisions aimed at helping domestic automakers that were included in the U.S.M.C.A. trade deal.\"We've been chopping wood for a while, and it feels like everyone else is seeing what we've been seeing for a long time,\" said Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law who is overseeing his campaign. \"Everyone else has been distracted, but it's not like we invented these policies for the State of the Union.\"What's unclear, and what could prove decisive, is whether the country is exhausted by Mr. Trump and is ready for a so-called return to normalcy, or if voters have grown inured to his eruptions and have effectively priced in his behavior.A key factor will be the candidate the Democrats eventually nominate. Interviews with more than a dozen Republican strategists, lawmakers and state chairs reveal a consensus that Senator Bernie Sanders would be the easiest Democrat for them to beat because they believe his avowed socialism would help them reclaim suburbanites and better frame the election as a choice.\"It's easy to call him a socialist because he admits it,\" said Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor. \"At least Warren tries to deny it.\"Mr. Sanders's aides, of course, see it very differently and believe that they would tear up Mr. Trump's 2016 electoral map by reclaiming working-class white voters in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, something some Trump advisers agree with. And Trump advisers have been caught by surprise by the success of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind.\"We don't have a Democratic opponent yet,\" said Mr. Cramer. \"It's always harder to run against the unnamed opponent. Once you have the opponent, you get to draw the distinctions.\"PhotographPresident Trump on Friday in North Carolina.

Stone Jr. \"The president was right to call it out,\" Mr. Meadows said. A week after that, Mr. Meadows was on Fox again, offering commentary on a Democratic debate. \"The clear winner tonight,\" he concluded, \"was Donald Trump.\"For three years, Mr. Trump could reliably count on tuning into his favorite television network and finding his favorite congressman carrying his flag in one political battle after another. Now Mr. Meadows, a retiring Republican representative from North Carolina and onetime leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, will transform himself from outside ally to inside consigliere as he takes over as Mr. Trump's fourth White House chief of staff in 38 months.Whether he can be any more successful than his predecessors in managing a White House that defies management remains to be seen, but Mr. Meadows takes over at a moment of singular challenges for the president. The country faces a health, economic and societal crisis with the coronavirus even as it heads into a presidential campaign season that if anything promises to be even more brutal than the last one in 2016.Reince Priebus, John F. Kelly and Mick Mulvaney each tried to navigate Mr. Trump's harum-scarum West Wing in his own way, alternately trying to control, channel or enable the advice-resistant president, only to eventually fall out of favor. Mr. Meadows has an advantage none of them did in that he has been a political confidant and ardent champion for much longer before taking the job and many in Mr. Trump's circle were encouraged by his ascension. But he has never been tested like this before.\"The president hasn't gone through four chiefs of staff in three and a half years because he's trying to figure out how to govern,\" said Chris Whipple, the author of \"The Gatekeepers,\" a history of those who served in the role. \"He's gone through four chiefs because he's not interested in governing. He lives to campaign -- to divide, demonize and disrupt -- not to get things done.\"[Video: Watch on YouTube.]In that sense, then, Mr. Meadows may make sense. A former real estate developer turned conservative bomb-thrower, Mr. Meadows made his name as a disrupter of the system, clashing repeatedly with House Republican leaders over spending, immigration and other issues, and inciting the rebellion that forced Speaker John A. Boehner to step down in 2015.Mr. Meadows has helped blow up bipartisan deals over the budget, health care and immigration that he argued had sold out conservative principles and was an architect of the partial government shutdown of 2018-19 that failed to win Mr. Trump the border wall money he demanded. He famously blew up at Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner's successor, on the floor during a contentious vote.Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan considered Mr. Meadows an irresponsible agitator who cared only about getting attention for himself and nothing at all about governance. Rather than making progress, they believed, Mr. Meadows cared only about making a point. But to his admirers, Mr. Meadows puts principle above pragmatism even at a cost to his own party.\"It's a great move by the president,\" Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, said on Saturday of Mr. Meadows's appointment. \"Mark Meadows is the best strategist in Washington, and he's a great wartime consigliere and we're heading into election season. Mark understands the president's electoral coalition and his unique ability to cut through the normal morass of Washington to get things done.\"While unpopular among establishment Republicans, Mr. Meadows has a genial manner that has helped him forge unlikely relationships with some Democrats, who say that unlike Mr. Trump, he can vigorously argue issues without making it personal. And he has cultivated good relationships with reporters, becoming a comfortable and regular television presence.Among his most notable friends across the aisle was Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who died in October and was a top target of Mr. Trump's racially charged attacks on Twitter. Mr. Meadows gave a moving eulogy at Mr. Cummings's memorial service that talked about the value of the \"unexpected friendship.\"\"I would describe Mark as an unusual empath just in terms of how he can relate to people,\" Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State, another Democrat with whom he has a good relationship, said on Saturday. \"We do disagree on so many things, yet I do think he's someone who makes things about policy and not people.\"Ms. Jayapal, a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, emphasized that she considered Mr. Meadows's policies destructive but appreciated that he treated others with decency and respect. \"I don't see Mark Meadows being able to change the president on that,\" she said. \"I don't think that's possible. And if he thinks that's possible, he's probably kidding himself. It just makes me sad because he will end up being corroded.\"Born on an Army base in Verdun, France, to a soldier and a civilian nurse, Mr. Meadows, 60, grew up mainly in Florida, a self-described \"fat nerd\" and an aspiring weatherman in a family without much money. But he later lost weight and became a businessman in Florida and North Carolina, where he owned a restaurant for 20 years before going into real estate. He ran for the House in 2012 as an outspoken critic of the Republican establishment.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Meadows encouraged the so-called birther movement that spread the lie that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. \"2012 is the time we are going to send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is,\" he said that year. He later called it \"probably a poor choice of words on my part,\" and said that he believed Mr. Obama was an American citizen.But he was not initially sold on Mr. Trump. By the 2016 election year, Mr. Meadows had helped found the Freedom Caucus, which made a point of prioritizing fidelity to conservative policy over party-line discipline, much to the chagrin of Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan. Mr. Trump, a former Democrat who once supported abortion rights and gun control, was a suspect figure.Mr. Meadows privately expressed reluctance to go to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that year because he did not want to be associated with Mr. Trump, and thought it was only a question of how badly the reality television star would lose that year not whether he would, Tim Alberta wrote in \"American Carnage.\"Still, he campaigned for Mr. Trump in the fall, even after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that sent other Republicans fleeing, a loyalty the candidate never forgot. When Mr. Trump proved him wrong on Election Day, Mr. Meadows made a point of aligning himself with the incoming president, so much so that it provoked a shouting match at a Freedom Caucus meeting where other members were concerned, according to Mr. Alberta's book.Over the past three years, Mr. Meadows proved to have considerable influence over Mr. Trump, urging him to reject compromises with Democrats and moderate Republicans. He was seen in the West Wing and spoke with the president probably more than any other congressman -- so much so that some White House aides reportedly sought to block his calls.Other Republicans considered the advice Mr. Meadows was giving Mr. Trump unnecessarily destructive. \"Mr. President, Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus are not your friends,\" former Representative Robert Pittenger, a fellow North Carolina Republican who lost in a primary in 2018, wrote last year in the Charlotte Observer. \"They laud you on Fox News then undermine your legislation.\"Mr. Meadows was also reproved by the House Ethics Committee in 2018 for mishandling sexual harassment allegations against a top aide. The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work.But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump's most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president. At one point early last year, during testimony by Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who described the president as racist, Mr. Meadows sought to counter the allegation by presenting a black political appointee of Mr. Trump's.Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, called it racist to \"actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee.\" Angry and indignant, Mr. Meadows rejected the idea that he was a racist and demanded an apology. Mr. Cummings, who was African-American, came to his defense, calling Mr. Meadows \"one of my best friends,\" and Ms. Tlaib apologized. But many lawmakers of color remained livid about the exchange.Mr. Meadows rose to the president's defense again when the House debated impeaching him for coercing Ukraine to incriminate his Democratic rivals by withholding security aid. After the House voted to impeach, the president enlisted Mr. Meadows and other Republican allies as adjunct members of his defense team for the Senate trial, deployed to the cameras to denounce the case.Mr. Meadows announced in December that he would not run for a fifth term, but made clear that he would remain in Mr. Trump's camp. \"My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,\" he said at the time. Many suspected he would end up in Mr. Mulvaney's corner office so few if any were surprised when Mr. Trump announced it by Twitter on Friday evening.\"Mark is always up for the challenge,\" Mr. Gaetz said. \"We all knew when Mark wasn't running for re-election that he didn't lose one ounce of vigor for the fight, and it's no surprise to see the president turn to one of his closest confidants to lead the government.\"PhotographRepresentative Mark Meadows mingling with attendees last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md.

His supporters agree.TOLEDO, Ohio -- President Trump's supporters nodded approvingly last week as Mr. Trump extolled the \"big, beautiful monster\" of a trade deal that he will sign with China on Wednesday.The enthusiastic group, gathered at Toledo's Huntington Center, nodded again as Mr. Trump insisted that America's farmers, who have been hurt by the trade war with China, were winners and as he asserted, incorrectly, that American importers were not paying for the tariffs.\"And now the deal is done,\" Mr. Trump said.The packed arena roared triumphantly.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump will sign an initial trade agreement with Beijing that will help cool tensions between the world's two largest economies but leaves many of the biggest issues unresolved. Key details of the agreement remain murky, the text remains under wraps and more complicated matters, like China's financial support for companies that compete with American firms, have been pushed until after the 2020 election.But to Mr. Trump's most faithful backers, the president took on China and scored a major win.\"Instead of giving all the money to China, now we're going to get some of it back,\" said Kim Lewis, 65, a corn and soybean farmer from Jamestown, Ind., who drove four hours to see Mr. Trump's speech. \"He had the guts to stand up to these other countries.\"The optimism surrounding the outcome of the negotiations reflects the deep trust that Mr. Trump's supporters have in a president who promised to stop China from \"ripping off\" the United States and has declared victory in rewriting the terms of trade.Mr. Trump's public selling of the deal, along with his rosy views about the American economy, have transcended any downside of his economic policies. Support for Mr. Trump and his trade deal remain strong in places like Ohio, where economic growth and manufacturing employment shows signs of slowing.National employment data released Friday showed that 12,000 factory jobs were shed in December. Manufacturing employment has been slumping in the industrial Midwest in the last year amid the lingering trade war. Employment in the state's goods-producing industries decreased by 10,100 from November 2018 to November 2019, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.For those devoted enough to Mr. Trump to brave frigid weather and long lines to attend a midweek campaign rally, any responsibility for economic malaise was directed elsewhere.\"Tariffs aren't the answer, but Trump's back was put up against the wall,\" said Timothy Pedro, the Republican mayor of Waterville, Ohio, who noted that businesses in his town had been holding back investment as a result of trade uncertainty. \"He had to do something.\"At the Toledo rally, Mr. Trump steered clear of specifics about the trade agreement, focusing on the promise that it will be enforced with the threat of more tariffs and the commitment he received from China to increase its purchases of American farm products to $50 billion a year -- nearly double what it bought at the 2012 peak.Critics of the deal have said it is unrealistic that China will ramp up its farm purchases so quickly. And they argue that Mr. Trump chose political expediency by settling for an interim agreement that would calm markets amid his re-election campaign but do little to resolve the administration's biggest concerns about China's unfair economic practices.To Mr. Trump's most ardent backers, however, the piecemeal approach was yet another sign of the president's deal-making prowess.\"You can't get everything at one time,\" said Jeff Colwell, 54, a car parts manufacturer who lives near Columbus. \"Anything we can do to equalize trade with China is a good thing.\"In agreeing to the deal last month, Mr. Trump reduced tariffs he had placed on $360 billion of Chinese goods and opted against taxing another $160 billion of imports. China agreed to enforce stronger protections for American intellectual property, open its markets to American financial institutions and commit to greater transparency surrounding the management of its currency.The agreement provides Mr. Trump with a policy win to hail, but it also deprives him of a useful foil to rail against. China-bashing is a well-worn tradition for Republicans and Democrats in election years. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both criticized their predecessors for coddling China despite its human rights abuses and unfair trade practices during their campaigns in 1992 and 2008. As the Republican candidate in 2012, Mitt Romney assailed Mr. Obama for allowing China's theft of American intellectual property to flourish under his watch.Mr. Trump has made being tough on China one of his hallmarks and has spent much of his first term assailing it as an enemy and threatening to tax all of its imports. But polling that showed his tariffs were wearing thin on his base and a desire to score a policy victory ahead of the election spurred him to strike an interim deal.Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises Mr. Trump, said that Mr. Trump's campaign advisers have realized that the president's supporters are less concerned about China's record of human rights abuses or fears that it is an existential threat and more interested in having greater access to its market. He said that Mr. Trump appears to be shifting his tone on China away from the caustic rhetoric used by Stephen K. Bannon, his former chief strategist, in favor of an argument that shows how the president succeeded in \"opening up\" China.\"The concern of the base about China is not the demonization of China; the concern is the ripped-off jobs and lost trade opportunities, the money part of it,\" said Mr. Pillsbury.Democrats have largely struggled to settle on a forceful critique of Mr. Trump's China strategy, accusing him of settling for a weak deal and warning that China may ultimately ignore the agreement.Still, supporters of the president appear ready to blame China, rather than Mr. Trump, if the deal does not hold.Randy Rothenbuhler, who owns a corn and soybean farm 45 minutes south of Toledo, said that his soybeans had been piling up in bins for the last year because of Chinese retaliation. He is hopeful that the new agreement will mean the reopening of China's market, but he will remain skeptical until he sees it happen.\"That's the billion-dollar question, will China live up to its promise?\" Mr. Rothenbuhler, 42, said. \"We'll have to wait and see.\"Although Mr. Trump might have to shift away from lashing out at China in the wake of the agreement, he appears likely to make the case that he alone could have struck such a deal and that no one else can hold China to its word.\"They're going to do what he wants them to do,\" said Michelle Sellati, a forklift driver from Lima, Ohio. \"If China just works with Trump, they'll benefit, too.\"PhotographPresident Trump in Toledo, Ohio, announcing the China trade deal he intends to sign Wednesday.

Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is running for president.Mr. Trump pointed at the ceiling above him, marveling at all of his own success. \"Maybe it's right there, right?\" he said. \"Thank you. Thank you, God.\"Throughout an animated 90-minute speech in front of conservative activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, a confident Mr. Trump attacked his rivals in nasty terms while gloating about and inflating his own achievements.He even exited the stage by embracing the American flag in both of his arms, mouthing the words \"I love you\" and planting a kiss on the stars and stripes.Mr. Trump talked up what he said were his administration's successes: the appointment of conservative judges, the killing of terrorists, tax cuts and the passage of trade deals. But he appeared most animated when riffing about the Democratic presidential field, on the same day that voters in South Carolina headed to the polls to vote in the first primary where a majority-black electorate is set to weigh in.Mr. Bloomberg, whose mammoth spending has privately concerned Mr. Trump, \"writes checks like a drunken sailor,\" the president said, ribbing the former mayor for spending more than half a billion dollars on a presidential bid that Mr. Trump predicted would not make it past Super Tuesday on March 3.\"That was probably the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates,\" he said of Mr. Bloomberg's debut this month on the debate stage, which was widely viewed as a bubble-bursting showing for a potential dark horse candidate. \"It just shows you, you can't buy an election. You got to bring the goods a little bit, too.\"Handicapping the Democratic primary, Mr. Trump said that he expected to face off against Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, or former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\"Everyone knows he's not a communist,\" he said of Mr. Biden. \"With Bernie, there's a real question about that.\" But Mr. Trump said his concern about Mr. Biden was his mental acuity.\"The difference is Joe's not going to be running the government,\" he said. \"He's just going to be sitting in a home some place.\"Mr. Trump, who arrived late at CPAC after holding a last-minute news conference at the White House to announce expanded travel restrictions related to the spread of the coronavirus, mentioned the outbreak only in passing.Congratulating himself on his administration's response, Mr. Trump said the decision to impose early travel restrictions \"has been now given very good grades, like an A +++.\" And he promised a nonpartisan response to the coronavirus, even as he attacked Democrats.\"The extreme fringes called us racists,\" he said. \"They wanted to let infected people pour into our country.\"On Friday, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, addressed the same audience at CPAC, and accused journalists of hyping the coronavirus because \"they think this will bring down the president -- that's what this is all about.\"On Saturday afternoon, however, Mr. Trump appeared less interested in discussing the outbreak that has been the first public health crisis of his presidency. Instead, he was eager to bask in the warm reception of the conservative audience, who spent the past four days listening to a procession of speakers road-testing messages for Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.He lauded his decision to fire James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director. \"That was a great firing,\" he said.He claimed that even Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the lone Republican to vote to impeach Mr. Trump on one article, abuse of power, had split the baby. \"Even him, I got half a vote,\" he said. \"He couldn't do it all. He wanted to get nice free publicity for himself.\"Mr. Trump also falsely characterized the 2017 tax cut as the \"largest\" in history (several others outrank it), and claimed that he had eliminated the estate tax. In reality, the 2017 law increased the threshold but the tax still exists.Mr. Trump has been a regular speaker at CPAC for years, and has credited the organization for giving him a platform long before he officially declared his run for president. In 2015, however, when he was still a New York businessman, the crowd booed him when he proposed fighting ISIS with troops on the ground in the Middle East.But for the past four years, he has been the main attraction and headliner of the conference, which has been molded in his image. Last year, Mr. Trump delivered the longest speech of his presidency from the CPAC stage, clocking in at two hours five minutes. (That year, he opened, rather than closed, with a flag hug.)In an election year, his address was more in line with the staple speeches he has been giving at campaign rallies, and it set no records for length.But he appeared particularly awed by his own abilities to keep the spotlight on himself.\"I can get elected twice over the wall, can you believe this,\" he told the crowd, while claiming, falsely, that Mexico was paying for the construction of a wall along the southern border.\"Yes they are, they are paying for it,\" he said, adding, without explaining himself, \"oh, they're going to die when I put in what I'm going to do.\"Mr. Trump also claimed he was not bothered that Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist whom Time named its person of the year, occupied a magazine cover he has long coveted, even though he chose to bring up an issue that was published over two months ago. \"The whole world revolves around this person,\" he said, referring to himself. \"Every story is Trump or Trump-related.\"Linda Qiu contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographThose at CPAC have spent four days listening to speakers road-testing messages for President Trump's re-election campaign.

Happy New Year!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday evening, in some of his most bellicose language of the year toward Iran.The growing crisis has strained Mr. Trump's aversion to war with Iran as well as his distaste for Middle East entanglements generally, including in Iraq. Mr. Trump faced pressure from hawkish allies in Washington to confront Iran forcefully, while memories of the deadly attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, loomed over the administration.Many analysts said Iran had thrown the Trump administration on its heels and was forcing a president entering his re-election year into unpalatable decisions about escalation and the risk of wider conflict.\"The Iranians believe Trump has shown he doesn't want to go to war,\" said Vali Nasr, a former State Department official in the Obama administration and a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. Mr. Nasr said that Iran's leaders were \"making the president realize there is risk and cost to his policy\" of crippling sanctions on the country's economy.The siege on the embassy created an unwelcome holiday crisis for Mr. Trump, who has spent the past week out of sight, splitting time between his Mar-a-Lago resort estate in Florida and his luxury golf club a few miles away. Mr. Trump has not spoken to reporters since Christmas Eve and was absent from a Sunday evening news briefing at Mar-a-Lago during which three of his top national security officials discussed American airstrikes against an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia.But on Tuesday the White House said Mr. Trump spoke by telephone with Iraq's prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, imploring him to help protect Americans in the country.Although Iraq has seen mass anti-government protests in recent months, Mr. Trump left no doubt that he viewed the embassy assault as Tehran's handiwork. \"Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq,\" he tweeted. \"They will be held fully responsible.\" Mr. Trump also ordered a contingent of Marines to protect the American personnel there.No Americans were harmed in the assault on the compound, and the attackers did not enter any embassy buildings. But the Trump administration was treating the threat as a serious new escalation by Iran, two days after Mr. Trump approved the airstrikes against the militia group that American officials said launched a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that killed an American contractor and wounded four American soldiers.The events of the past several days amount to a violent cat-and-mouse game between Washington and Tehran, as Iran bridles under economic sanctions and seeks to exact a price from the United States. Those sanctions contributed to mass protests that the country's leaders say were instigated by the United States to bring down Iran's regime.Trump administration officials, particularly Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have long spoken about the need to \"restore deterrence\" against Iran to check its military activities in the Middle East. They blame President Barack Obama for emboldening Tehran through the 2015 nuclear deal. But supporters of the agreement say that Mr. Trump's May 2018 withdrawal from it prompted Iran and its proxies to adopt a more aggressive posture toward the United States.Meanwhile, some of Mr. Trump's allies fear that a president who has repeatedly called for winding down \"endless wars\" has effectively condoned Iranian behavior by shying away from military force. In mid-June, Mr. Trump ordered limited airstrikes to punish Iran for shooting down an expensive American drone near its coastline, only to call off the attack at the last minute. Mr. Trump also defied calls from some Republican supporters to strike at Iran after it attacked a major Saudi oil production facility in September.Mr. Trump has also said he would like to negotiate a new nuclear agreement with Iran's leaders. But Iran has refused to discuss its nuclear program until Mr. Trump rolls back economic sanctions, including on oil exports, a step the president has refused to take.Mr. Trump was cheered on by some Republican allies on Tuesday, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a longtime advocate of confrontation with Iran who golfed with the president in Florida on Tuesday.Mr. Graham praised Mr. Trump on Twitter for \"acting decisively\" and told Iran that the president \"will hold you accountable for threats against Americans and hit you where it hurts the most.\" He also issued a veiled threat of further military action, telling the Iranian government that \"a country that depends on the ability to refine oil for its existence needs to be cautious.\"Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said Iran \"must be held responsible.\"Complicating the picture was what a senior Trump administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on Monday, cast as longtime frustration with the Iraqi government, saying it has not sufficiently protected American military and diplomatic personnel from Iranian-backed militia groups. About 5,000 American troops and several thousand more civilians remain in Iraq nearly a decade after the United States officially ended its occupation of the country.Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized the 2003 American invasion of the country as a colossal mistake and has been eager to withdraw American forces from neighboring Syria.Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that \"we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!\"But much of Iraq's political establishment has bitterly complained about the American airstrikes within its borders. The strikes hit Shiite militia fighters who, while aligned with Iran, helped to defend Iraq from the Islamic State in recent years and have close ties to the country's leadership.\"The story in Iraq has shifted,\" Mr. Nasr said, as prior anger at Iranian influence in the country is displaced by outrage at Washington. \"I think the administration has miscalculated.\"On Tuesday, Mr. Trump tried to keep the focus on Iranian influence in Baghdad.\"To those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don't want to be dominated and controlled by Iran, this is your time!\" Mr. Trump implored on Twitter as demonstrators set up camp at the gates of the American Embassy in Iraq's capital.Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, warned in a tweet against conflating the embassy attack with mass protests that have gripped Iraq in recent months.\"The attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad is straight from Iran's playbook in 1979,\" Mr. Bolton wrote. \"It's a sign of Iranian control over Shia militia groups, not a sign of Iraqi anti-Americanism.\"Some foreign policy analysts said the fast-moving crisis pointed to muddled thinking within the Trump administration about its approach toward Iran.\"Trump, who would just as soon withdraw wholesale from Iraq, faces a conundrum in an election year: How to avoid looking weak on the one hand and yet avoid triggering a messy conflict with Iran and deeper involvement in Iraq on the other that will alienate his base and energize his opponents,\" said Aaron David Miller, a former State Department official and Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Mr. Trump's public pledges to disentangle the United States from wars in the Middle East are more complicated and problematic than they appear, former officials and analysts said. While the president has talked about withdrawing American troops, he has actually added troops in some areas, most notably about 3,000 to Saudi Arabia in an order issued in October. The key factor there was Saudi Arabia's willingness to pay the costs of maintaining the troops, a persistent issue with Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has signaled a strong distaste for engagement in foreign conflicts in nearby Syria. He surprised top advisers by withdrawing American troops from the Syria-Turkey border in October and allowing Turkey to invade a Kurdish-held area in Syria. Mr. Trump eventually agreed to keep some troops by oil fields in Syria after senior Defense Department officials stressed to Mr. Trump that the soldiers would be securing oil.The president announced in December 2018 that he planned to withdraw troops from Syria, prompting the resignations of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a veteran Marine general, and Brett H. McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the international coalition battling the Islamic State.On Tuesday morning, the State Department said Mr. Pompeo had spoken with Mr. Mahdi, and Iraq's president, Barham Salih, in separate calls. A summary of the calls released by the department said that Mr. Pompeo \"made clear the United States will protect and defend its people, who are there to support a sovereign and independent Iraq,\" and that the Iraqi leaders \"assured the secretary that they took seriously their responsibility for and would guarantee the safety and security of U.S. personnel and property.\"The safety of embassy employees is fraught for Mr. Pompeo. He delivered blistering criticism of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when he was a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which investigated the decisions she made around the 2012 attack on the diplomatic compound in Libya. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens; another full-time government employee, Sean Smith; and two American C.I.A. contractors died in that attack.Former State Department officials and associates of Mr. Pompeo say because of that history and the ensuing harm to Mrs. Clinton's political career, he is keen to ensure that American diplomats under his watch are not harmed. Republican politicians say that Mr. Pompeo might run for an open Senate seat in Kansas in 2020 and then president in 2024.That history was clearly on the mind of the president himself. By late Tuesday afternoon, with embassy security beefed up and the imminent threat seemingly repelled, Mr. Trump boastfully tweeted: \"The Anti-Benghazi!\"In May, during a period of heightened tensions with Iran, Mr. Pompeo ordered most non-Iraqi employees of the Baghdad embassy and the consulate in Erbil, in northern Iraq, to leave the country. Employee numbers at the embassy are now much lower than they were before that order, American officials say. In September 2018, Mr. Pompeo ordered the closing of the Basra consulate, despite the opposition of the top diplomat there.In response to the turmoil in Baghdad on Tuesday, the American military conducted a show of force with helicopter gunships and deployed about 120 Marines to reinforce the compound's grounds, a Defense Department official said. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper also said that about 750 soldiers would be sent to the region immediately, and that additional troops were prepared to follow in the coming days.Mr. Esper called the deployments \"an appropriate and precautionary action,\" adding, \"The United States will protect our people and interests anywhere they are found around the world.\"Michael Crowley reported from West Palm Beach, and Edward Wong from Washington. Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographIran \"will be held fully responsible\" for demonstrators' attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad, President Trump, top, said on Tuesday.

Now add a pandemic.The future of America's health insurance system has already been a huge part of the 2020 presidential race. At campaign events over the past year, voters have shared stories of cancer diagnoses, costly medications and crushing medical debt.That was before more than 68,000 people in the United States tested positive for the coronavirus, grinding the country to a halt, upending lives from coast to coast, and postponing primary elections in many states. The virus has made the stakes, and the differing visions the two parties have for health care in America, that much clearer.\"Health care was always going to be a big issue in the general election, and the coronavirus epidemic will put health care even more top of mind for voters,\" said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization. \"Sometimes these health care debates can get a bit abstract, but when it's an immediate threat to the health of you and your family, it becomes a lot more real.\"On Monday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. sent a letter to President Trump and Republican state officials that emphasized the sorts of immediate threats Americans are feeling, and criticized those Republicans for supporting litigation that targets the Affordable Care Act. The letter called it \"unconscionable that you are continuing to pursue a lawsuit designed to strip millions\" of coverage in the midst of a pandemic.Mr. Biden sent his missive on a health care milestone: the 10th anniversary of when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law -- with Mr. Biden, then the vice president and now the likely Democratic presidential nominee, standing by his side.While the Democrats spent much of their primary fighting about whether to push for \"Medicare for all\" or build on the Affordable Care Act, the coronavirus crisis may streamline the debate to their advantage: At a time when the issue of health care is as pressing as ever, they can present themselves as the party that wants people to have sufficient coverage while arguing that the Republicans do not.\"A crisis like the coronavirus epidemic highlights the stake that everyone has in the care of the sick,\" said Paul Starr, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton who served as a health policy adviser in the Clinton White House. \"It really strengthens the Democratic case for expanded health coverage, and that should work, I should think, to Biden's advantage in a campaign against Trump.\"The virus is also having dire economic consequences, depriving Mr. Trump of a potent re-election argument rooted in stock market gains and low unemployment numbers. It is testing Mr. Trump's leadership in the face of a national emergency like nothing he has encountered, and if voters give him poor marks, that could inflict lasting damage on his chances in November's general election.\"It's a leadership argument,\" said Representative Donna E. Shalala, Democrat of Florida, who served as secretary of health and human services for President Bill Clinton. \"Who do you want to be president of the United States when there's a big health crisis?\"In addition, the virus is a providing an unmistakable reminder that Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden have starkly different views about the future of American health care -- and starkly different records on the issue.Four years ago, Mr. Trump ran for president promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. But his campaign pledge quickly turned into a debacle in the first year of his presidency when Republicans struggled and ultimately failed to repeal and replace the health law. In the midterm elections the next year, Democrats emphasized health care, highlighting issues like preserving protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and they won control of the House.That line of argument has already surfaced in the 2020 election cycle. \"Too many Montana families go to sleep at night worried about health care -- coverage, costs, now the fear of coronavirus,\" the narrator said in a recent ad targeting Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, who is up for re-election. The ad was run by Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act and has set up a coronavirus \"war room\" aimed at holding Mr. Trump accountable over his handling of the crisis.Mr. Trump is particularly vulnerable on the issue of health care. Over the course of his presidency, his administration has repeatedly taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act, including by arguing in court that the entire law should be invalidated. The Supreme Court agreed this month to hear an appeal in that case, which is the latest major challenge to the law. The court is not expected to rule until next year, but Democrats point to the Trump administration's legal position as yet another example of the president's desire to shred the Affordable Care Act.All together, those steps by Mr. Trump and his administration amounted to something of a policy piñata for Mr. Biden and other Democrats to swing at in the general election, even before the coronavirus threat emerged.\"Trump wants to take health care away,\" said Representative Ami Bera of California, a physician. \"Democrats and Vice President Biden want to extend health care and make it affordable.\"In his campaign, Mr. Biden has already put a focus on health care, promising to build on the Affordable Care Act and create a so-called public option, an optional government plan that consumers could purchase. On the campaign trail, he has talked about his own exposure to the health care system, including when his late son, Beau Biden, had brain cancer. He has also regularly heard from people about their own struggles. \"They walk up and grab me and say, 'I just lost my daughter, cancer,' or, 'My son's dying,' or, 'I have Stage 4,\"' he recalled this year.Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said Mr. Trump had \"spent almost his entire presidency attempting to cost millions of Americans their health coverage,\" adding: \"The coronavirus outbreak, which Trump has egregiously mishandled, would be even more catastrophic if he had his way on health care.\"At a Fox News town hall event this month, Mr. Trump said he had not \"been able to sell what a great job we've done\" on health care. While the president and congressional Republicans failed at repealing the Affordable Care Act, they succeeded at undoing a key part of the law when, as part of their 2017 tax overhaul, they eliminated the tax penalty for people who go without insurance.The Trump campaign has already attacked Mr. Biden over health care, including by arguing that he poses a threat to private health insurance with his proposal to create an optional government plan.\"As President Trump is leading our country and taking unprecedented action to stop the coronavirus, Joe Biden is campaigning on his Bernie Sanders-inspired, socialist health care agenda, which would take away Americans' access to quality health care,\" said Sarah Matthews, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. \"Make no mistake about it, Biden's government-run 'public option' is just another name for a government takeover of the entire health care system.\"And although the Affordable Care Act has gained in popularity during Mr. Trump's presidency, Republicans can still point to rising health care costs as a problem that voters want to see addressed. In that vein, Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a physician, cited the substantial premiums and high deductibles that many consumers have.\"Democrats have to have a credible plan to control health care costs,\" Mr. Cassidy said. \"If you look at what the No. 1 concern is, it is the cost of health care.\"In the Democratic primary race, the health care debate has largely focused on the divide between moderate-leaning Democrats looking to build on the Affordable Care Act and progressives calling for Medicare for all, a government-run health insurance program. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders represent the two sides of that argument.Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, faces long odds at catching up to Mr. Biden in the delegate race, but he has remained in the primary and continues to push progressive policy ideas, including on health care. In response to the virus, he has pointed once again to the need for Medicare for all.\"It is nearly impossible to believe that anyone can still think it's acceptable to continue with a health care system that leaves tens of millions of people uninsured,\" Mr. Sanders said this month. \"The cruelty and absurdity of that view is more obvious in the midst of this crisis than it has ever been.\"In a poll this month by Morning Consult, four in 10 Americans said the coronavirus outbreak had made them more likely to support universal health care proposals in which everyone would receive their health insurance from the government.Under the single-payer system that Mr. Sanders is proposing, private health insurance would be eliminated -- a potential political vulnerability that Republicans would most likely exploit in the general election if the Democratic nominee supported Medicare for all. Mr. Biden, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Sanders's health care proposal during the primary, does not share that vulnerability.At one of his final campaign stops before the virus shut down in-person campaigning, Mr. Biden visited a community health center in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he spoke of his pride in having worked with Mr. Obama to pass the Affordable Care Act.\"I'm running to protect the progress we fought for,\" Mr. Biden said. He cast doubt on Mr. Sanders's plans for a single-payer system and spoke about the urgent need to improve health care -- now more evident than even two weeks ago.Talking about the patients at that clinic, he said, \"They can't afford to wait for a revolution.\"PhotographA nurse worked at a drive-up coronavirus testing site in Yuba City, Calif., on Monday.

While the lawyers did not contest the basic facts of the case, they maintained that Democrats' accusations in effect seek to punish Mr. Trump for foreign policy decisions and efforts to preserve executive prerogatives.\"They do not remotely approach the constitutional threshold for removing a president from office,\" the brief said. \"The diluted standard asserted here would permanently weaken the presidency and forever alter the balance among the branches of government in a manner that offends the constitutional design established by the founders.\"The White House also announced on Monday night that it had assembled a team of eight House Republicans to serve as part of the president's defense team, including some of his fiercest defenders, like Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and John Ratcliffe of Texas.Mr. McConnell's trial rules, which limited each side's arguments to 24 hours over two days, gave the White House a helping hand at the outset and drew swift anger from Democrats. The rules left open the possibility that the Senate could not only decline to hear new evidence not uncovered in the House impeachment inquiry, but could also sidestep considering the House case against Mr. Trump altogether -- although such a vote is considered unlikely.\"Under this resolution, Senator McConnell is saying he doesn't want to hear any of the existing evidence, and he doesn't want to hear any new evidence,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \"It's a cover-up, and the American people will see it for exactly what it is.\"He said he would propose changes during what promises to be a rancorous debate over the rules on Tuesday in the Senate.In their own detailed legal brief submitted on Saturday, the House impeachment managers outlined their case that Mr. Trump corruptly solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election for his own benefit by pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals while withholding nearly $400 million in security aid the country desperately needed as well as a coveted White House meeting for its president.\"President Trump did not engage in this corrupt conduct to uphold the presidency or protect the right to vote,\" the seven House Democratic impeachment managers said Monday in a second filing that rebutted many of the president's assertions. \"He did it to cheat in the next election and bury the evidence when he got caught.\"\"Mr. Trump's answer to the charges offers an unconvincing and implausible defense against the factual allegations in Article I,\" the managers wrote. \"The 'simple facts' that it recites confirm President Trump's guilt, not his innocence.\"The legal brief filed by Mr. Trump's lawyers did not deny that the president asked Ukraine to announce the investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., nor that he withheld military aid that Congress had approved for Kyiv. But Mr. Trump's lawyers said that he never tied the investigations to a White House meeting or to the security assistance.They also argued that the president has the right to conduct relations with other countries as he sees fit and that he had valid reasons to raise those issues with Ukraine and withhold the security aid because he wanted to root out corruption there and get other countries to share the burden of providing military assistance.The lawyers dismissed the notion that doing so was an abuse of power, as outlined in the first article of impeachment, calling that a \"novel theory\" and a \"newly invented\" offense that would allow Congress to second-guess presidents for legitimate policy choices.\"House Democrats' concocted theory that the president can be impeached for taking permissible actions if he does them for what they believe to be the wrong reasons would also expand the impeachment power beyond constitutional bounds,\" the brief said. \"It is the president who defines foreign policy,\" it added, and said that Mr. Trump had \"legitimate concerns\" in raising the issues involving Democrats with the Ukrainians.The lawyers argued that the second article, accusing Mr. Trump of obstructing Congress by blocking testimony and refusing to turn over documents during the House impeachment inquiry, was \"frivolous and dangerous\" because it would invalidate a president's right to confidential deliberations in violation of the separation of powers.In making their case, the White House lawyers themselves embraced novel interpretations of the history of impeachment. Far from newly invented, the concept of abuse of power was envisioned by the framers from the start. Alexander Hamilton specifically described impeachment as a remedy for the \"abuse or violation of some public trust.\"Moreover, the House Judiciary Committee adopted articles of impeachment accusing both Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton of abuse of power for, among other things, defying congressional demands for information.Many constitutional scholars have long said that impeachable offenses do not have to be specific violations of a criminal code, but could be broader violations of a president's oath of office or offenses against the republic. In the case of President Andrew Johnson, one of the articles against him alleged no violation of law but impeached him anyway for speeches bringing Congress into \"disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach.\"While the White House brief argued that the articles against Mr. Trump did not allege an actual crime, a report released last week by the Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan government agency, found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the security aid allocated by Congress.The president's legal team took issue with the Government Accountability Office's conclusion and said that, in any case, it was irrelevant because it was not included in the articles of impeachment themselves.The White House brief stressed that Mr. Trump ultimately met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and released the aid even though the Ukrainians never announced the investigations the president had sought. But the money was delivered and the meeting was set only after a whistle-blower had filed a complaint alleging impropriety by the president and lawmakers had opened their own investigation into why the money had been blocked.The dueling filings rolled in as both sides braced for a contentious trial on the Senate floor over whether to remove Mr. Trump, only the third such impeachment proceeding in the country's history. The president visited the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington on Monday afternoon before he left for Davos, Switzerland, where he planned to meet with other world leaders at an economic conference as the Senate began weighing his fate.In the Capitol, the House managers and the president's defense team took turns privately touring the Senate chamber and surrounding offices, transformed over the weekend into a court of impeachment that will open on Tuesday with the debate on the rules for the trial. According to Mr. McConnell's timetable, oral arguments by the House managers would begin on Wednesday, followed by a presentation by Mr. Trump's team.The White House announcement that it will add House Republicans to its defense team came despite objections from Mr. McConnell. In deference to him, they will not argue the case on the Senate floor, but will provide guidance and appear as surrogates, according to a person working with Mr. Trump's legal team.In addition to Mr. Jordan, Mr. Meadows and Mr. Ratcliffe, those joining the team include Representatives Doug Collins of Georgia, Mike Johnson of Louisiana, Debbie Lesko of Arizona, and Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin of New York.In their filing on Monday, House Democrats sought to dismantle the president's case. By arguing that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense, they said, Mr. Trump's lawyers were ignoring the intentions of the founders and in effect asserting that \"the American people are powerless to remove a president for corruptly using his office to cheat in the next election.\"The managers also said the president's attempt to justify his obstruction failed to account for the House's broad prerogative to conduct their inquiry. The House investigation was \"properly authorized,\" they insisted, and they pointed out that Mr. Trump never actually invoked executive privilege, but merely raised the threat of doing so to discourage officials from testifying.The nine-page filing was technically a response to a shorter pleading submitted by Mr. Trump's team on Saturday.The president weighed in himself, complaining that he had not been treated fairly and dismissing demands by Mr. Schumer for a trial that would include witnesses and testimony that the president has so far blocked.\"Cryin' Chuck Schumer is now asking for 'fairness', when he and the Democrat House members worked together to make sure I got ZERO fairness in the House,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \"So, what else is new?\"Mr. McConnell had said repeatedly that he was modeling his rules on the procedures for Mr. Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial, but he made changes that could tilt the playing field in Mr. Trump's favor. While the Clinton-era rules imposed no limits on the 24 hours of oral arguments allowed on both sides, Mr. McConnell condensed them into two marathon-session days, which would allow the Senate to blaze through them by Saturday.Senators could then pose questions to the two sides next week before debating whether to allow the prosecution and defense to try to call witnesses or seek documents. A senior Republican leadership aide conceded on Monday that Mr. McConnell had deviated from the 1999 rules, which admitted the House impeachment record into evidence at the start of the trial, in requiring a separate Senate vote to do so this time around. The change was necessary, argued the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail internal strategy, because the House had denied the president proper due process rights.The House invited Mr. Trump to mount a defense before the House Judiciary Committee during its impeachment proceeding, including requesting witnesses and documents, but the president's legal team declined, saying it would not dignify an inquiry it deemed illegitimate with a response.Peter Baker and Nicholas Fandos reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Schiff of California, the lead House manager. \"And the result has been, and will continue to be, grave harm to our nation if this chamber does not stand up and say this is wrong.\"Hours later, as his allotted time ticked down, Mr. Schiff also appealed to the consciences of Republican senators weighing whether to hear from witnesses and seek more documents that Mr. Trump suppressed.\"I ask you -- I implore you,\" Mr. Schiff said. \"Give America a fair trial. She's worth it.\"But those same senators appeared unmoved -- not just on the question of whether to acquit Mr. Trump, which they were expected to do, but also on the crucial question concerning witnesses and documents.\"We have heard plenty,\" said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican.Mr. Schiff's fiery final oration appeared to alienate the very Republicans he was trying to win over. When he referred to an anonymously sourced news report that Republican senators had been warned that their heads would be \"on a pike\" if they voted against Mr. Trump, several of them vigorously shook their heads and broke their sworn silence: \"not true.\"\"I hope it's not true,\" Mr. Schiff said in response.He and the six other managers prosecuting the president spent much of Friday tying up the facts of the second charge, obstruction of Congress, and arguing that Mr. Trump's attempts to shut down a congressional inquiry into his actions toward Ukraine was unprecedented and undermined the very ability of the government to correct itself.\"He is a dictator,\" said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York. \"This must not stand.\"As day turned to evening on the fourth full day of the trial, many senators unaccustomed to long hours in the Capitol appeared to have simply been numbed by the House managers, and were anticipating the president's defense, set to begin at 10 a.m. Saturday.The Senate was presented with three days of often an vivid narrative and painstaking legal arguments that Mr. Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 election on his own behalf, by using vital military aid and a White House meeting as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.Yet the pool of moderate Republican senators that had expressed openness to joining Democrats in insisting on witnesses or new documents appeared to be dwindling. Comments by Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska suggested that they may have cooled to the idea, although Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah gave no indication that they had shifted.Still, Ms. Collins was among those shaking her head when Mr. Schiff referred to the purported threat against Republican defectors.Ms. Murkowski said: \"'Head on a pike,' that's where he lost me. I thought he did fine until he overreached.\"Democrats promptly accused the Republicans of being melodramatic, suggesting they were merely looking for any excuse to ignore Mr. Schiff's prodding.Without an agreement to take new testimony or subpoena documents relevant to the case, Mr. Trump may be headed toward a historically speedy acquittal in as little as a week from now, before the Iowa caucuses or his planned State of the Union address. That would make the third impeachment trial of a president in American history the shortest.Throughout Friday, inside and outside the chamber, the House managers and Democratic senators hinted strongly at the political stakes if Republicans failed to press for a more thorough airing of the charges against the president.\"We've made the argument forcefully, the American people have made the argument forcefully that they want the truth,\" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. \"Will four Republican senators -- just four -- rise to the occasion, do their duty to the Constitution, to their country to seek the truth?\"They appeared to get an unexpected lift early in the day when a 2018 recording surfaced of Mr. Trump appearing to order the firing of Marie L. Yovanovitch, then the United States ambassador to Ukraine. The recording was first reported by ABC News and later handed over to the House by Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer.The recording appeared to confirm earlier claims by Mr. Parnas that he had told Mr. Trump about rumors that Ms. Yovanovitch was not loyal to him. The House's impeachment inquiry concluded that the ambassador was ultimately removed in 2019 as part of Mr. Trump's attempt to strong-arm Ukraine to announce investigations of his political adversaries.\"Get rid of her,\" Mr. Trump can be heard to say, according to ABC. \"Get her out tomorrow. I don't care.\"Mr. Trump's defense team plans to open its arguments on Saturday, though senators were expected to meet for only an abbreviated, two- to three-hour session before adjourning the trial until Monday afternoon.Mr. Trump was not pleased about the schedule, writing Friday morning on Twitter that his team had been \"forced\" to start on a Saturday, a time \"called Death Valley in T.V.\" He also turned around Democrats' accusation, declaring that \"the Impeachment Hoax is interfering with the 2020 Election,\" not him.Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, said his team would treat the weekend session like a \"trailer,\" providing an overview of their case for acquittal while holding back until Monday the president's more television-friendly lawyers, the former independent counsel Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz.Democrats used almost every one of the 24 hours afforded to them by senators to make their case, determined to persuade American voters watching at home who will cast ballots in just 10 months, if not senators.On Wednesday, Mr. Schiff and each of the managers took turns introducing the facts of the case in narrative form, unfolding the tale of Mr. Trump's alleged misconduct chapter by chapter. Beginning with the abrupt removal of Ms. Yovanovitch, they said that Mr. Trump empowered first Mr. Giuliani and then American officials to push Ukraine to announce investigations of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats, before himself asking that country's leader to \"do us a favor.\"When the Ukrainians resisted, they added, he withheld a coveted White House meeting and almost $400 million in military aid the fledgling democracy badly needed to fend off a menacing Russia. And when Congress found out, he undertook an across-the-board campaign to block officials from testifying or producing records that would reveal the scheme.On Thursday, Mr. Nadler lectured extensively on the constitutional and historical standards for impeachment, setting the stage for the managers to methodically argue that Mr. Trump's actions toward Ukraine constituted an impeachable abuse of power that warrants his removal from office.Mr. Schiff completed that case on Friday, directly engaging the national security implications of Mr. Trump's actions as he argued that the president was a serial offender in seeking foreign help for his own political benefit, allowing himself to be used as a tool of Moscow's agenda in the process. As a candidate, Mr. Trump welcomed Russia's interference in the 2016 election to help him win the White House, Mr. Schiff noted, and then as president, he repeatedly cast doubt on the conclusions of American intelligence agencies about that interference. Later, Mr. Trump said outright that he would welcome foreign campaign assistance again.The California Democrat played a video of the news conference in Helsinki, Finland, where Mr. Trump stood next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and accepted his denial that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election.\"That's one hell of a Russian intelligence coup,\" Mr. Schiff said. \"They got the president of the United States to provide cover for their own interference with our election.\"At another point, Mr. Schiff showed a clip of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who was an outspoken champion of Ukraine and Russia hawk, promoting the benefits of bipartisan American support for Kyiv to contain Russia and its anti-democratic agenda.The move appeared to be a subtle effort to appeal to Republican senators, many of whom respected Mr. McCain and share his strongly anti-Russia stance, to place those values above their loyalty to the president.As the managers moved on to the obstruction of Congress charge, they contended that Mr. Trump's blockade of evidence was far more pernicious than the kind of partisan squabbles that are typical between Congress and the White House.Even Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard M. Nixon, they said, had produced documents to the investigations that would threaten them with impeachment. Mr. Trump's administration had not handed over a single page, declaring for the first time an across the board objection to House subpoenas.Trying to head off Mr. Trump's defense team, which argues that the president was lawfully protecting the interests of the executive branch from a politically motivated House, the managers pointed out that he never actually invoked executive privilege, the legal mechanism afforded to presidents.\"Only one person in the world has the power to issue an order to the entire executive branch,\" said Representatives Val B. Demings, Democrat of Florida. \"And President Trump used that power not to faithfully execute the law, but to order agencies and employees of the executive branch to conceal evidence of his misconduct.\"Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman, Carl Hulse, Catie Edmondson, Michael D.

Trump made clear that he would treat the stock market as a crucial yardstick of his success in office.\"The world was gloomy before I won -- there was no hope,\" he wrote on Twitter on Dec. 26, 2016. Since his election, he said, \"the market is up 10%.\" (It was up, but not that much.)In the three years since, Mr. Trump has obsessed over the daily gyrations of the stock market like no president before him. He trumpeted its relentless rise as a validation of his leadership, his financial acumen and his policies. Disappointing days were the fault of Democrats, the media or the Federal Reserve. Stocks, he warned, would crash if he was impeached or \"if anyone but me takes over in 2020.\"Now his bragging rights and doomsday threats have evaporated -- along with trillions of dollars in wealth.Stocks continued their monthlong meltdown on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling about 4.5 percent to below where it stood when Mr. Trump was sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2017. The S&P 500 also sank more than 4 percent, though it remains up -- barely -- during the Trump presidency.The implosion -- stocks have collapsed about 35 percent since the coronavirus spread globally last month -- is shaping up to be one of the most destructive periods in American financial history. More than $8 trillion in shareholder value has been destroyed. On four occasions in the past month, automatic circuit breakers halted trading to stall dizzying sell-offs. The plunge is the steepest since at least 1928.The market collapse isn't Mr. Trump's fault, although some of his decisions may not have helped, including his statements minimizing the danger of the virus. The fast-spreading pandemic has forced countries all over the world to essentially shut down their economies, and that probably would have happened in the United States regardless of who was in the White House.But the speed and violence of the fall have stunned just about everyone. Only a month ago, on Feb. 19, Mr. Trump was in chest-thumping mode. \"Highest Stock Market In History, By Far!\" he crowed on Twitter.That day turned out to be the market's peak.From the start of his presidency, some of Mr. Trump's policies have seemed tailor made to catapult the stock market to new heights. His landmark legislative achievement -- the $1.5 trillion tax-cut package that he signed into law at the end of 2017 -- handed out rich rewards to corporate America. The windfall fattened profits and led to a frenzy of companies buying back their own shares, which propelled stocks still higher.Investors loved it. Bankers loved it. Corporate executives loved it. The money showered upon them from tax cuts and the seemingly invincible bull market mollified even those who privately grimaced at the president's pronouncements and social policies.But nobody loved it like Mr. Trump. He has tweeted about the stock market at least 131 times since becoming president. He kept a running tally of stock market records -- 135 by his last count, on Dec. 19. He personalized the rally, referring to \"my stock market gains.\"In some ways, Mr. Trump, with his fixation on the markets, has resembled old-school corporate chieftains like Sandy Weill. As chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, Mr. Weill kept moment-to-moment tabs on his company's stock price, viewing it as the best quantifiable measure of his performance. But Mr. Weill got out before the reckoning. Two years after he retired in 2006, Citigroup, deep in debt and burdened with toxic assets after years of financial recklessness, required $45 billion in taxpayer bailouts.By taking credit, over and over, for the stock market's record run, Mr. Trump arguably set himself up to be blamed for its record fall. (Mr. Trump has repeatedly insisted that he be measured by the market's performance starting on Nov. 9, 2016, the day after his election, rather than when he took office. By that measure, stock markets are still up on his watch, though not by much.)So deeply has Mr. Trump interwoven his fortunes with those of the markets that plenty of members of the Trump-loathing left have watched markets plunge with a dose of schadenfreude.\"If you politically live by the stock market, you can politically die by the stock market,\" said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington. She said she hoped that, with Mr. Trump no longer able to bask in the warmth of an epic market rally, the public would have a clearer view of his deficiencies. But, she added, \"I'm not rooting for the market to tank.\"Democrats' distrust of Mr. Trump runs deep. Some have kept their money out of the stock markets, according to a team of economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studied anonymized data about the stock portfolios for millions of investors.\"People who are more likely to be Republicans, after the 2016 election, were a bit more likely to put money into the stock market, while Democrats do the opposite,\" said Antoinette Schoar, an M.I.T. professor.For a long time, as markets roared, that meant missing out on big profits. Now it's not looking like such a bad decision.\"I'd wished I'd went to even more cash,\" said Tom Leohr, a 65-year-old Iowa retiree who said he had significantly reduced his stock holdings after Mr. Trump won the election.\"I know buy-and-hold is the way to go,\" said Mr. Leohr, who worked for 30 years at the John Deere tractor works in Waterloo. \"But I just couldn't do it with Trump, just couldn't. Still can't.\"Even as markets were cratering this month, Mr. Trump has clung to the good days.As he spoke at a White House news conference on the afternoon of March 13, the stock markets staged a 9 percent rally. It wasn't enough to recover from the drop the day before, but Mr. Trump was so jubilant that he printed out a chart of the day's market activity, autographed it and sent it to a Fox Business anchor.\"BIGGEST STOCK MARKET RISE IN HISTORY YESTERDAY!\" Mr. Trump shouted on Twitter the next day. (It was the Dow's biggest gain in total points, but the biggest percentage gain only since 2008.)Those gains were erased within moments of the opening of markets the next Monday -- and Mr. Trump, for the first time in his presidency, adopted a more philosophical tone.The best thing to do for stocks is to contain the coronavirus, he said at a press briefing on Monday. \"The market will take care of itself.\"PhotographA month ago, President Trump declared on Twitter, \"Highest Stock Market In History, By Far!\" But stocks have collapsed about 35 percent since then.

Her Republican detractors say she put moderate Democrats in political peril and weakened the House inquiry by failing to wage a prolonged legal fight to obtain critical testimony that the president was blocking.And Republicans gloat that the failed attempt at removing Mr. Trump has only made him more politically powerful, energizing voters to rally behind a president who survived the ultimate effort to take him down.But Democrats argue that Ms. Pelosi won by losing, setting the stage for an election that is not only about the kitchen table issues that carried them to the majority in 2018, but also about exposing the president as unfit for office -- and Republicans as complicit in his misbehavior. In an interview Monday, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats had forced Republicans to do what Mr. Trump never has: Admit that he was wrong to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.\"I think that we have pulled back a veil of behavior totally unacceptable to our founders, and that the public will see this with a clearer eye, an unblurred eye,\" she said, adding: \"Whatever happens, he has been impeached forever. And now these senators, though they don't have the courage to assign the appropriate penalty, at least are recognizing that he did something wrong.\"Impeachment has been a tricky enterprise for both parties on both sides of the Capitol. In the Senate, where Democrats are in the minority, Mr. Trump's impeachment trial -- which is expected to conclude with his acquittal on Wednesday -- forced vulnerable Republicans in swing states to align themselves with a president who brooks no dissent. They bristled at being painted as beholden to Mr. Trump, reacting angrily when the lead House impeachment manager referred to a news report that said Republican senators had been told their heads would be \"on a pike\" if they voted against him.But in the House, impeachment was widely viewed as a gamble for moderates who represent districts where Mr. Trump is popular. While Ms. Pelosi gets generally good marks from her rank and file, some centrist members now grumble privately that she made some tactical missteps.Her refusal to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate for several weeks after the House adopted them, which forced a delay in the Senate trial, generated blowback in swing districts, said Democratic lawmakers who insisted on anonymity to speak candidly. They cringed when Ms. Pelosi made a spectacle out of the eventual signing of the articles in January, when she distributed commemorative pens to colleagues. Critics said it undermined her own oft-stated message that this was a \"somber\" and \"prayerful moment\" for the country.\"Her whole thing was this was a solemn moment, and that was undignified to do a pen ceremony,\" said one moderate Democrat in Congress, who insisted on anonymity for fear of retribution from the speaker. \"A lot of us in the front line felt that wasn't helpful.\"Other Democrats have questioned the decision to impeach Mr. Trump without exhausting the House's legal remedies to compel the testimony of key White House witnesses. Those fights could have taken months, potentially pushing a vote to charge him up against the presidential election, or even beyond.But most Democrats defend Ms. Pelosi. With the economy booming and unemployment low, Mr. Trump should be coasting to victory in 2020, they say. Instead, Republicans like Senators Marco Rubio and Lamar Alexander now say Mr. Trump violated the bounds of appropriate presidential behavior. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, on Monday called Mr. Trump's behavior \"shameful and wrong,\" and said he had degraded the office.\"It has raised the stakes,\" said Representative Tom Malinowski, a centrist freshman Democrat from New Jersey who faces a tough re-election challenge from the son of a popular former governor. \"I don't think it's a loss. It illuminates that the next election isn't just about whether we continue Trump's crazy policies; it's whether we remain a constitutional democracy. That is a debate I am absolutely confident we are winning.\"And at the end of the day, Mr. Trump will still go down as only the third president in American history to be impeached. It is an \"ugly distinction,\" in the words of Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a progressive advocacy group.It is no secret in Washington that Ms. Pelosi was never eager to impeach the president. She resisted it for months -- even after Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, outlined 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice by the president. She said it would be too divisive and that it ought to be bipartisan, comments that Republicans throw back at her today.\"She's violated her own criteria in this case when she said it had to be bipartisan,\" said Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia. \"If anything, it's bipartisan -- she lost two of her members. I think that's the question she's got to answer.\"(Mr. Davis was referring to Representatives Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Collin Peterson of Minnesota; both voted against impeachment, but Mr. Van Drew has since become a Republican.)Ms. Pelosi has answered the question before. She argues, as she did on Monday, that in trying to use Ukraine to gain an advantage in the 2020 election, \"the president gave us no choice but to protect and defend our Constitution and oath of office we take.\" While some say that Mr. Trump's acquittal will only embolden him, both Ms. Pelosi and Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, insisted the inquiry and trial had, at the very least, increased scrutiny of a president who ordinarily feels no constraints.\"To those who would say that the president will now feel unbound, he already felt unbound,\" Mr. Schiff said.Ms. Pelosi put it this way: \"I think the spotlight that is on him will be very hot for him to handle.\"Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said that in impeaching and trying Mr. Trump on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors, Democrats had \"not gained very much except for intensifying the feelings about the president, both pro and con.\"But Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican congressman from Florida who lost re-election in 2018, said that in pursuing impeachment, Ms. Pelosi may have created an opportunity for Democratic presidential candidates to follow the playbook of George W. Bush, who campaigned in 2000 on restoring dignity to the White House after the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.\"The opportunity for Republicans is to make gains with those voters who think impeachment is just out of step and a zealous enterprise,\" Mr. Curbelo said, \"and for Democrats, it's with those voters who are growing tired of all the scandal and controversy and wanted a more fair and complete process in the Senate.\"In the interview, Ms. Pelosi took aim at both Mr. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. Mr. McConnell managed to eke out the 51 votes he needed to prevent the Senate from subpoenaing witnesses like John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, whose forthcoming book confirms the allegations against Mr. Trump. (Asked whether the House intends to subpoena Mr. Bolton, Mr. Schiff said Democrats would have \"more to say about that later.\")Calling Mr. McConnell a \"wholly owned subsidiary of the White House,\" and Mr. Trump his \"puppeteer,\" Ms. Pelosi said the president had also tarnished the Senate.She lapsed into a tough-guy cadence as she described her view of the president's message to senators, as delivered by the majority leader: \"You don't even have a choice, you ain't gonna hear no witnesses, you ain't gonna see no documentation, 'cause we're not letting you do it -- and by the way, you are going to put your imprimatur on it.\"On Tuesday evening, the fraught dynamic between Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Trump will be on display in the Capitol, at the very spot on the House rostrum where she presided over the votes to impeach him. During last year's State of the Union address, Ms. Pelosi was photographed smirking as she clapped sideways at Mr. Trump. The image went viral, interpreted by many as a sarcastic gesture by the speaker, though she has said she did not intend it that way.This time, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats stand ready to work with the president on the issues he is expected to discuss, like infrastructure and lowering the cost of prescription drugs, but she did not sound entirely eager to hear him speak.\"It will have a beginning, a middle and an end -- and then it will be over,\" she said. \"So what's the big deal?\"Ms. Pelosi said she had not spoken to the president since mid-October, when she went to the White House to participate in a meeting about Syria and abruptly left after a confrontation with Mr. Trump. (A White House photograph of her wagging her finger at the president went viral, too.)When he arrives at the Capitol on Tuesday night, she said, Democrats would treat Mr. Trump \"as a guest in our House -- and we hope he will behave as a guest in our House.\"\"But,\" she added, \"we never have that expectation.\"Trump on Trial is a continuing series of articles offering reporting, analysis and impressions of the Senate impeachment proceedings.Trump on Trial is a continuing series of articles offering reporting, analysis and impressions of the Senate impeachment proceedings.PhotographSpeaker Nancy Pelosi said the president's impeachment \"pulled back a veil of behavior totally unacceptable to our founders.\" (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1669Show lessYou have requested \"on-the-fly\" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

But the political landscape has sharply shifted.President Trump faces the biggest challenge yet to his prospects of being re-elected, with his advisers' two major assumptions for the campaign -- a booming economy and an opponent easily vilified as too far left -- quickly evaporating.After a year in which Mr. Trump has told voters that they must support his re-election or risk watching the economy decline, the stock market is reeling and economists are warning that a recession could be on the horizon because of the worsening spread of the coronavirus.And instead of elevating Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as Mr. Trump made clear was his hope, Democrats have suddenly and decisively swung from a flirtation with socialism to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has run a primary campaign centered on a return to political normalcy.\"Biden's success in the suburbs makes him an acceptable alternative to Trump,\" said Scott Reed, the top political adviser for the United States Chamber of Commerce. \"His turnout in the suburbs threatens the Republican Senate.\"That presents Mr. Trump with a confounding new political landscape, one that close advisers concede he had seemed unwilling or unable to accept until Wednesday, when he addressed the nation about the pandemic.\"If it was Warren or Bernie and you don't have coronavirus, I think Trump might sneak by,\" said Kevin DeWine, the former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. \"But if it's Biden, 'My I.R.A. has tanked,' and we're going to have complete disruption because of coronavirus, I think it's a totally different story.\"Ohio, a traditional presidential battleground that has been trending Republican, would be in play again, Mr. DeWine said. Such Midwestern states were central to Mr. Trump's election in 2016, and are likely to be similarly crucial this year.Of course, what happens in March may ultimately have little bearing in November. Mr. Trump maintains the bully pulpit of the presidency, and Mr. Biden largely avoided intense scrutiny from rivals in a crowded, up-and-down primary campaign.And if there's any constant in the Trump era, it is that what's in the news at a given moment will change in a matter of hours, days or at most weeks. The virus may be mitigated, the economy could rebound, and Mr. Biden's decades of life in Washington and propensity for gaffes may render him as weak a candidate as some of his rivals in the primary had long predicted.Yet if Mr. Trump does lose re-election, the seeds of demise may prove to have been planted in early spring.One challenge for the president is that the type of management response required of chief executives during crises like a pandemic has never been his strength. Empathy and public displays of emotion do not come easily to him. On Twitter, his favorite medium, he has been consumed by how people are perceiving his handling of the crisis and has focused on criticizing Democrats.And so far, he has resisted entreaties from advisers to cancel events, or to send a strong signal that he's willing to put the political season on hold as the full effects of the coronavirus are assessed.\"A leader needs to be transparent, clear, empathetic, serious, and all-in,\" said Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida who ran against Mr. Trump in the 2016 Republican primary and received bipartisan praise for how he handled hurricanes during his tenure. \"A leader needs to communicate consistently and regularly. A leader needs to show his or her heart, which has to be done outside the governor's mansion or the White House.\"Mr. Bush added that a leader needs \"to shut down partisan politics and campaigning\" and \"to trust the experts and allow the strategy to be developed with them,\" as well as think about how to deal with the recovery.Mr. Biden, by contrast, has had his entire political life defined by his personal tragedies -- including the death of his wife and daughter decades ago, and then his eldest son, Beau, more recently -- and his efforts to rise from them and encourage others to do the same.On Wednesday afternoon, shortly before he was scheduled to speak to reporters, Mr. Trump rebuked congressional Democrats, who have indicated they aren't waiting for the president's guidance on an economic package to help the economy. \"Someone needs to tell the Democrats in Congress that CoronaVirus doesn't care what party you are in. We need to protect ALL Americans!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.In interviews, a half-dozen Republicans close to the president's campaign said that his re-election effort had become a political battleship, slow and creaky to turn, unlike the nimble race Mr. Trump ran in 2016. Several advisers worked on Tuesday to persuade Mr. Trump not to let the campaign announce a rally tentatively scheduled for the end of the month in Florida; those advisers ultimately won.Aides have sent mixed signals about how they plan to approach Mr. Biden, with some wanting to portray him as a 2020 version of Hillary Clinton, and others wanting to try to define him as interchangeable with Mr. Sanders because of some of the progressive stances Mr. Biden has adopted.Primary results cannot easily be projected onto general elections, but the surge in Democratic turnout so far has not only helped Mr. Biden, it has also illustrated what may be Mr. Trump's most glaring vulnerability. The former vice president has established a commanding delegate lead in part because of a surge of suburban voters including many from affluent jurisdictions.In Virginia, North Carolina and Michigan -- each a general election battleground -- Mr. Biden benefited from a large increase in turnout among moderate voters in the Washington, Charlotte and Detroit suburbs.In Michigan, for example, over a million and a half voters participated in the Democratic primary Tuesday -- up from just over 1.2 million in 2016 there. But it was where the turnout jumped so much that was revealing and, for Mr. Trump, ominous. In affluent Oakland County, Mitt Romney's boyhood home and an epicenter of the Democrats' 2018 midterm election gains, turnout went from approximately 180,000 in 2016 to about 260,000 on Tuesday.Mr. Trump's team of actual political strategists is small, despite the large staff employed by his campaign, and his campaign manager only recently relocated to Washington, where the headquarters is based. After data leaked early on, information is closely guarded and formal polling is ordered only every few months. On Tuesday, as Mr. Trump sat with advisers in the late morning going over the results of the latest campaign surveys, some of the data was already out of date.Representative Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican who is not seeking re-election, said the likelihood that Mr. Biden would be the nominee alone \"makes this a race.\"Mr. Rooney said Mr. Biden was \"moderate, well-reasoned and genuinely likable -- none of those things are what Sanders are.\"And echoing a number of leading officials in both parties, Mr. Rooney said that if Mr. Biden wins the nomination, it would illustrate the degree to which 2016 was a referendum on the Democratic nominee rather than on Mr. Trump.\"The question is how many people voted for him because they didn't want Hillary Clinton,\" he said, arguing that Mr. Biden's center-left politics effectively made him \"Hillary without the other negatives.\"Mr. Trump's advisers argue otherwise -- and indeed it was their enthusiasm for digging into the record of Mr. Biden's son Hunter that led to the president's impeachment.But what alarms many Republicans about the political impact of the virus is that it will so overwhelm the news that it will be difficult to highlight their opposition research about Mr. Biden or draw attention to his gaffes.One prominent party strategist working on a number of congressional races this year said a series of polls taken in the last two weeks showed the president's approval ratings receding to where they were before the 2018 midterms, giving back the gains he made in the aftermath of his impeachment acquittal.This strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about Mr. Trump, said he worried the virus and its effects on the economy would make this campaign entirely about the president, much like the 2018 midterms.And no modern president may perform better with a foil or worse when measured in his own right than Mr. Trump.Nonetheless, there have been some constants in terms of how Mr. Trump is perceived by voters.\"The president's job approval has bounced around between 42 percent and 46 percent ever since the spring of 2018, so variation within that range should not be interpreted as anything particularly significant,\" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. \"If he should break above 46 percent or below 42 percent in the polling averages, then I'll start to take that seriously.\"Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican facing a potentially competitive re-election, said it was premature to make sweeping assessments about an election so far off. \"That's a lifetime in politics, especially today,\" he said.But he did offer Mr. Trump a dose of tough-love advice and, in doing so, he suggested that the president's prospects might hinge in part on how he handles the current health crisis.\"Don't talk about politics, just march forward and do your job,\" Mr. Roy said, adding that voters would ask, \"'Did we react properly?' That's how the judgment will fall.\"Mr. Rooney was even more pointed, urging Mr. Trump to show leadership and take drastic steps to curb the spread of the virus. \"He ought to be doing what other countries are doing,\" he said, such as urging people to stay home, closing schools and demanding public events be rescheduled. \"It's a serious health risk here and you've got to ask: Where is the United States?\"But former Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican swept out in the 2018 suburban backlash to Mr. Trump, said that Mr. Biden's ascent had greatly complicated Mr. Trump's prospects.\"Joe Biden will be very palatable to some of the same moderates who voted against Republicans in the midterms,\" said Mr. Yoder, predicting that Republicans would need embittered Sanders supporters to stay home because \"we're not going to see a flip back of suburban independents.\"Mr. DeWine put it more bluntly: \"If it's Biden, you'll have disaffected Republicans run to the polls to vote for Biden because they're just looking for normal and sane,\" he said.PhotographPresident Trump, who was counting on a racing economy and a strong showing by Senator Bernie Sanders, now faces the prospect of a moderate opponent in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., left, and a possible recession.

The French have Bastille Day, so they invited the president to view their elaborate military parade down the Champs-Élysées. The Japanese have an emperor, so they invited Mr. Trump to be the first foreign leader to visit their newly installed monarch -- and threw in a sumo match with a special presidential trophy for good measure.Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India opted to appeal to Mr. Trump's first love -- crowd size -- as he stages a rally of more than 100,000 people in Ahmedabad on Monday after a drive in from the airport along roads where perhaps 100,000 more will line the motorcade route. The president will almost certainly not be greeted by the 10 million people he expects, but it will look like an enormous crowd nonetheless and, the Indians hope, satisfy his need for affirmation.\"World leaders are vying with each other to appeal to President Trump's vanity,\" said R. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state under President George W. Bush who helped pave the way for agreements with India during that administration. \"They understand his foreign trips are more about the image he wants to strike rather than substantive breakthroughs between governments.\"White House aides deny that the president's trips are all about show. The United States and India have important issues involving trade and security for Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi to discuss, although administration officials briefing reporters before the president's departure from Washington on Sunday made clear that the comprehensive trade agreement he seeks with India remains far-off.What has seemed to animate Mr. Trump the most, though, are Mr. Modi's promises of cheering crowds. \"He told me we'll have seven million people between the airport and the event,\" Mr. Trump told reporters last Tuesday.Two days later, Mr. Trump ratcheted up the estimate to eight digits. \"I hear they're going to have 10 million people,\" he said at a campaign rally. \"They say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world.\"By Sunday as he was leaving the White House to begin his long trip, it had become \"millions and millions\" of people. \"Some people say the biggest event they've ever had in India,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"That's what the prime minister told me.\"A crowd of 10 million would exceed the entire population of Ahmedabad, estimated at eight million. Local officials estimate that it will be more like 100,000, making Mr. Trump off by only 99 percent. But Motera Stadium, which is not really fully built yet, is supposed to become the largest cricket arena in the world.Other countries could not muster that show of force and so have taken advantage of whatever local assets they might have when Mr. Trump has come to visit. For Britain, of course, that would be Queen Elizabeth II, the world's longest-reigning monarch, who welcomed him to Buckingham Palace last year with an 82-gun salute and a lavish white-tie state banquet.\"Crowd size is important to this president, so he was clearly thrilled to be told there would be seven million people on the streets\" in India, said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States. \"We couldn't manage that in the U.K., but twice in the space of a year he seemed bowled over by the warmth of the welcome he received from the royal family.\"Mr. Trump was so blown away by the Bastille Day military parade in Paris when President Emmanuel Macron of France invited him in 2017 that the president insisted on organizing his own American equivalent along the streets of Washington as part of last year's Independence Day celebration.Perhaps with that in mind, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is trying to entice Mr. Trump to come to Moscow in May by inviting him to the Red Square parade marking the 75th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany. Mr. Trump, however, appears wary of the awkward politics of such a visit given the election year and Russia's continued interference in American campaigns.Japan eschews militarism and therefore military parades, but it sought to make Mr. Trump feel special by making him the first foreign head of state invited to meet Emperor Naruhito after his ascension to the throne. The Japanese also asked Mr. Trump to present his own trophy at a sumo champion match -- a four-foot-tall object duly labeled the President's Cup for the event.\"World leaders have learned to shorten or scrap the historical tours, remove local delicacies from the menu and focus on one thing only: feeding his ego,\" said Julianne Smith, the director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. \"That's taken different forms in recent years, but the goal is always the same -- make Trump feel like he's getting something unique: a parade in Paris, a grand state dinner at Buckingham Palace or a sumo match with a President's Cup in Japan.\"Not every country can compete. When Mr. Trump was due to travel to South Korea last year, the government in Seoul fretted over what it could come up with that would seem special. The South Koreans have no queen or emperor. But what they do have is a Demilitarized Zone, where Mr. Trump could visit and even, in a surprise first of its kind, step across into North Korean territory and stage a theatrical last-minute meeting with Kim Jong-un.Critics said that meeting, like a parade or a banquet, was just for the pictures, with no lasting result, and that the president should focus more on policy initiatives when he arrives in India. \"Trump would be far wiser to frame the visit on substance -- our strong military collaboration with India, Japan and Australia in limiting China, for example, rather than on seeking applause from crowds in a stadium,\" Mr. Burns said.But symbolism has its value as well, and if a major trade agreement is not in the offing, then the Indians are determined that Mr. Trump go home with warm feelings about their country, throwing in a sunset tour of the Taj Mahal and a state dinner as well.\"I think the optics, he will get more of them than other presidents do, because I think the Indians recognize that that is something that he will want and will appreciate and will perhaps keep them in good stead over the next few months,\" said Tanvi Madan, the director of the India Project at the Brookings Institution.And in addition to the crowds, India may have something to offer that other countries do not. \"I would not be surprised if the Indians named something after President Trump,\" Ms. Madan said. Like a village, something they did for President Jimmy Carter when he visited. \"I think you will see them take extra efforts on the optics front for this president.\"PhotographCommuters passing by cutouts of President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad, India.; Workers preparing a new entry gate at Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad, which President Trump is expected to visit.

That strength presents a challenge for the Democrats hoping to unseat him in November -- even though Mr. Trump's cheerleading is often overstated and parts of the economy are slowing, including manufacturing.That helps explain why Mr. Trump has played down economic damage from the coronavirus and dismissed the stock market plunge: They threaten to undermine the most effective story he tells about his presidency.\"The country is in great shape, the market is in great shape,\" Mr. Trump told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday, as stocks tumbled after the Federal Reserve's rate cut. The S&P 500 ended the day down about 2.8 percent.Mr. Trump has blamed any growth hiccups on external events, like the Democrats running for president, troubles at the aerospace giant Boeing and the Federal Reserve. He has praised consumers and the economy's strength, even as forecasters warn that the virus could dampen growth at least temporarily this year.On Monday, Mr. Trump suggested on Twitter that House Democrats pass a one-year cut in payroll taxes, a form of fiscal stimulus often aimed at boosting consumer spending at times of economic weakness. Yet the president did not concede any economic trouble.\"This is an incredible time for our nation,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging.\"That kind of rhetoric has served Mr. Trump well during his first three years in office, helping him win credit -- at least among supporters -- for what remains a strong economy. But experts warn that it has also helped widen a partisan divide on the economy, which may make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to reassure the public in the event of a crisis, like the spread of coronavirus.\"The aura of the office, where people might have deferred to the message about the state of the economy, I think today that's gone,\" said Shanto Iyengar, a political scientist at Stanford University. \"It's gone because of the hyper-partisanship.\"Americans who tune into Mr. Trump's messages are far more likely to echo his language on the economy and are more optimistic about it, according to a new nationwide poll conducted last month for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey.Respondents were asked to choose from a list of terms that could describe the state of the economy. Those who said they regularly watched or followed news coverage of Mr. Trump's speeches were about twice as likely to describe the economy as \"booming\" or the \"best economy ever,\" and they were far more likely to express confidence in the economy and give Mr. Trump credit for its condition.The split persisted among Democrats, independents and even among Republicans. More than eight in 10 Republican voters who regularly follow Mr. Trump's speeches say Mr. Trump deserves \"a lot\" of credit for the economy. Only about one in three Republicans who do not regularly follow the speeches said the same.Will Hicks, a 32-year-old survey respondent in the oil field town of Roosevelt, Utah, said Mr. Trump's election provided an immediate jolt to people in his area. He credits Mr. Trump and his boosterism for much of that, even though he said the president's claims were often overstated.\"His viewpoint is all positive, that we're going to get greater, we're going to improve our economy,\" Mr. Hicks said. \"I think that push forward, even though it might be a little bit of an exaggeration, has helped the economy.\"Some economists agree. Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Yale, has described Mr. Trump's cheerleading as the driving force behind the continuation of the now-record economic expansion over the last three years.In a presentation earlier this year -- in which he compared Mr. Trump's economic messaging to the spread of a pandemic virus -- Mr. Shiller reported than 62 percent of newspaper articles that mentioned a \"strong economy\" from 2017 to 2019 also mentioned Mr. Trump. That's more than twice the rate of association that President Bill Clinton enjoyed during a stronger economy in the late 1990s.Mr. Trump \"is our first motivational-speaker president,\" Mr. Shiller said.Mr. Trump made grand economic promises a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, and he reveled in the stock-market surge that followed his victory. Even before he took office, consumer and small-business confidence levels soared, driven largely by Mr. Trump's Republican supporters. Both measures have remained elevated throughout his term, with sentiment among Republican consumers hitting a record high in February in a long-running survey from the University of Michigan.But on several measures, the economy has fallen short of the president's promises. It grew 2.3 percent last year, well below the forecasts of Mr. Trump's economic team, as the president's trade war chilled business investment. Economic growth in the first three years of President Barack Obama's second term was nearly identical to that of Mr. Trump's first three years. Median wage growth is no higher today than it was in October 2016, and it remains well below the levels of the late 1990s.Small business owners' expectations for capital investment now are essentially unchanged from before the 2016 election. Among consumers, the postelection rise in confidence has failed to translate into a sustained improvement in spending, shattering a longstanding relationship. After Mr. Trump's election, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \"a gap opened up between the spending and confidence numbers, and that gap has persisted.\"The confidence gap is driven entirely by asymmetric partisanship, powered by a surge in Republican sentiment. When Mr. Obama was in office, surveys consistently showed that Democrats felt better about the economy than Republicans. When Mr. Trump was elected, the pattern reversed almost overnight, though the surge in Republican optimism was larger than the drop-off among Democrats.Masha Krupenkin, a Boston College political scientist, said Republicans show bigger swings in economic confidence, and exhibit a similar pattern in surveys that ask about trust in government, depending on which party controls the White House, compared with Democrats.The Times survey showed Democrats were less optimistic about the economy and less willing to credit Mr. Trump for it than Republicans were. Confidence among independent voters has fallen to a level between that of Democrats and Republicans, but closer to Democrats', during Mr. Trump's term. (Optimism among independents surged in January, but came back to earth in February, according to the Times survey.)Douglas Prasher, a Democratic voter in Prescott Valley, Ariz., said he didn't buy claims that the economy was doing well -- and he didn't think Mr. Trump deserved credit if it was. Mr. Prasher, 68, recently retired to Arizona from San Diego, which he said had become unaffordable because of sky-high housing costs. His new home state is cheaper, but he has still had to take on a part-time job to make ends meet. He carries hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt from helping his daughters go to college.\"As far as I'm concerned, people are suffering,\" Mr. Prasher said. The supposedly strong economy, he said, \"seems to only help the wealthy, which we're not in that category.\"That rhetoric echoes the message of Democratic candidates running for the White House, who frequently claim that the economy is \"rigged\" or only works for the very rich. Democrats in the Times survey were much more likely to use that phrasing to describe the economy than Mr. Trump's preferred terms. So were independents, who were six times as likely to call the economy \"rigged\" or badly broken\" as to say it was the \"best economy ever.\"Mr. Trump's aggressive claims -- that it is not just strong but \"the best ever\" -- may make him less credible to people not already inclined to support him, said Michele Claibourn, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. \"It's easier to resist as information if it feels exaggerated,\" she said.Ms. Claibourn said presidents have historically tried to distinguish between when they were speaking as party leaders and when they were addressing the public in their official, less partisan, capacity. Those lines have blurred over the decades. Under Mr. Trump, the distinction has disappeared almost entirely, she said.Jim Tankersley reported from Washington, and Ben Casselman from New York.PhotographPresident Trump at a rally in Charlotte, N.C.

Now Mr. Trump, who has said that the Constitution \"allows me to do whatever I want\" and pushed so many boundaries that curtailed past presidents, has little reason to fear the legislative branch nor any inclination to reach out in conciliation.\"I don't think in any way Trump is willing to move on,\" said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman who teaches at Princeton University. \"I think he will just have been given a green light and he will claim not just acquittal but vindication and he can do those things and they can't impeach him again. I think this is going to empower him to be much bolder. I would expect to see him even more let loose.\"Impeachment will always be a stain on Mr. Trump's historical record, a reality that has stung him in private, according to some close to him. But he will be the first president in American history to face voters after an impeachment trial and that will give him the chance to argue for the next nine months that his enemies have spent his entire presidency plotting against him to undo the 2016 election.\"This was clearly a political coup d'état carried out by a group of people who were amazingly, openly dishonest and I think it's going to be repudiated,\" said former Speaker Newt Gingrich, a strong ally of the president's. \"He's been beaten up for three solid years and he's still standing. That's an amazing achievement if you think about it.\"Even before a final vote on the impeachment charges on Wednesday, Mr. Trump has several high-profile opportunities in the next few days to begin framing the new post-trial environment to his advantage.On Sunday, he will be interviewed by Sean Hannity of Fox News during the pregame of the Super Bowl, one of the most watched television events of the year. Then on Tuesday, he will deliver his State of the Union address from the dais in the House chamber where he was impeached in December.A senior administration official briefing reporters on Friday said the president will use his State of the Union address to celebrate \"the great American comeback\" and present \"a vision of relentless optimism\" encouraging Congress to work with him. Mr. Trump plans to pursue an agenda of cutting taxes again, bringing down prescription drug prices, completing his trade negotiations with China and further restricting immigration.From there, Mr. Trump will head back to the campaign trail, starting with a rally in New Hampshire on Feb. 10, the night before the state's first-in-the-nation primary race, an effort to upstage the Democrats as they try to pick a nominee to face him in the fall.Democrats insist that Mr. Trump has been damaged by the evidence presented to the public that he sought to use the power of his office to illicitly benefit his own re-election chances. Even as they line up to acquit him, some Senate Republicans have acknowledged that the House managers prosecuting the case proved that Mr. Trump withheld $391 million in security aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure it to announce political investigations into his domestic rivals.But the public comes out of the impeachment trial pretty close to where it was when it started, divided starkly down the middle with somewhat more Americans against Mr. Trump than for him.When the House impeached him in December, 47.4 percent supported the move and 46.5 percent opposed it, according to an analysis of multiple surveys by the polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight. Now as the trial wraps up, 49.5 percent favor impeachment versus 46.4 percent who do not.Those numbers are strikingly close to the popular vote results from 2016, when Mr. Trump trailed Hillary Clinton 46 percent to 48 percent even as he prevailed in the Electoral College. That means that the public today is roughly where it was three years ago; few seem to have changed their minds. And the president has done nothing to expand his base and by traditional measures is a weak candidate for a second term, forcing him to try to pull the same Electoral College inside straight he did last time.Mr. Trump is the only president in the history of Gallup polling who has never had the support of a majority of Americans for even a single day, a troubling indicator for re-election. Nine months is an eternity in American politics these days and, given his history, Mr. Trump could easily create another furor that will change the campaign dynamics, the economy could become an issue, and with all the accumulated allegations some analysts anticipate a certain scandal fatigue could weigh him down.But Mr. Trump is gambling that he can rally his most fervent supporters by making the case that he was the victim and not the villain of impeachment while keeping disenchanted supporters on board with steady economic growth, rising military spending and conservative judicial appointments. He has made clear he will paint former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as corrupt if he faces him in the fall and will assail other possible Democratic challengers as socialists.If Mr. Trump does win a second term, it would be the first time an impeached president had the opportunity to serve five years after his trial and Mr. Trump's critics worry that he would feel unbound. He has already used his power in ways that presidents since Richard M. Nixon considered out of line, like firing an F.B.I. director who was investigating him and browbeating the Justice Department to investigate his political foes.While in theory nothing in the Constitution would prevent the House from impeaching him again, as a political matter that seems implausible given that he has demonstrated his complete command over congressional Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, leaving the president less to fear from a Democratic House. Some House managers warned that acquittal would lower the bar for presidential misconduct, meaning that Mr. Trump would feel even freer to use his power for his own benefit because he got away with it.\"He is going to ratchet it up to another level now,\" said Anthony Scaramucci, the onetime White House communications director who has broken with Mr. Trump. \"He's going to be Trump to the third power now. He's not going to be exponential Trump because that's not enough Trump. It's going to be Trump to the third power.\"But in that, Mr. Scaramucci said, are the seeds of Mr. Trump's own downfall because he could go so far that he finally alienates enough of the public to lose. \"The one person who absolutely can beat Trump is Trump,\" he said.No other impeached president had the opportunity or challenge that Mr. Trump does. President Andrew Johnson, who was acquitted in 1868, was a man without a party, a Democrat who had joined the Republican Abraham Lincoln's ticket, and was so disliked that both parties nominated other candidates shortly after his Senate trial, leaving him to finish his last 10 months in office a lame duck.Indeed, while Johnson was not removed from office, impeachment reduced him to a shadow president, said Brenda Wineapple, author of \"The Impeachers,\" an account of his trial.\"The Republicans still had a majority in Congress so they could reject some of his appointments, which they did, and override his vetoes of their legislation -- and they could allow the states that conformed to the Reconstruction Acts to re-enter the Union,\" she said. \"So in that sense, Johnson was hamstrung, if not powerless.\"President Bill Clinton was in his second term when he was impeached and acquitted, never to be on a ballot again. With nearly two years left in office, he tried to move on from his impeachment, all but pretending it had not happened. On the day of his acquittal in 1999, he appeared in the Rose Garden alone and expressed regret rather than vindication.\"I want to say again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the great burden they have imposed on the Congress and on the American people,\" Mr. Clinton said, calling for \"a time of reconciliation and renewal.\"As he turned to leave, a reporter called after him. \"In your heart, sir, can you forgive and forget?\"Mr. Clinton paused as if deciding whether to take the bait, then turned and answered, \"I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to be prepared to give it.\"Mr. Clinton, who unlike Mr. Trump admitted wrongdoing without agreeing that he committed felonies, never truly forgave his opponents, or reconciled with them, but for the most part he avoided expressing those feelings publicly.\"Clinton saw the acquittal as a humbling end to that chapter and I think Trump sees it as a way to start his re-elect,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, who was a top aide to Mr. Clinton. \"He just wanted to shut the door on that and move on and have a fresh start. And Trump sees it as a jump start -- 'this is what I'm going to run on.\"'Mr. Clinton had some help in that Republicans themselves emerged from his trial feeling bruised by their failure to remove him and the clear public repudiation of the impeachment in polls and the midterm elections. Unlike Mr. Trump, whose approval ratings remain mired in the mid-40s, Mr. Clinton's popularity reached its highest level during impeachment, with 73 percent of the public backing him just days after the House charged him with high crimes.\"I don't think Clinton was emboldened. I think he was embarrassed about the mess he caused and he wanted to somehow move on and fix his own reputation,\" said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who was a top adviser to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert at the time.And so did the Republicans. \"I think both the president and the speaker had a vested interest in moving past impeachment to getting things done,\" he said. \"We were very conscious about how polarizing impeachment was and we were dedicated to healing the country and repairing the G.O.P. brand.\"That does not seem like the likeliest path forward for Mr. Trump, more of a pugilist than a peacemaker. \"He's obviously legitimately pretty angry,\" said Mr. Gingrich, who was forced out as speaker after Republicans lost the midterm elections during the drive to impeach Mr. Clinton. \"Given that he's a natural counterpuncher, he may decide to go after them.\"\"That's not his best strategy,\" Mr. Gingrich said. \"His best strategy is to assume that the Democrats are totally out of control, that they will not be able to keep fighting. If he appears conciliatory, they're going to very badly damage themselves with average voters who are going to say these guys are pathological.\"\"He has that option,\" he added. \"I'm not saying he's going to take it.\"PhotographPresident Trump has emerged from impeachment with little reason to fear the legislative branch.

He was in a jovial mood, according to people who spoke with him, engaging in animated conversations with chief executives like Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, Sundar Pichai of Alphabet and Marc Benioff of Salesforce.He congratulated them on their companies' stock performances and joked that he should have bought shares but that he had been forced to sell his holdings when he took office. As Mr. Trump and his family members darted among meetings in makeshift pavilions, they studiously avoided questions about the drama back home, where the Senate engaged in a fierce clash over the rules for putting the president on trial.It was a day of two presidents. There was the stick-to-the-script Donald J. Trump riding high on a strong economy and representing the country on the international stage. And there was the Donald J. Trump under siege back home, depicted as an autocrat abusing the power of his office to take down domestic opponents and win re-election.The images of a calm and confident president in the wintry globalist getaway were supplanted in Washington by the images shown on television screens on the Senate floor by House managers playing video clips of his claims of unconstrained authority and his professed support for witnesses he has in fact blocked from testifying.The president took the advice of aides and friends and tried to remain above it all, or at least appear like it, more like Bill Clinton in 1999. When reporters asked him about the impeachment trial, he swatted it away as \"just a hoax.\"Leaving it at that, he proceeded to stick to his prepared remarks, making inflated claims about his role in a global economic recovery and promoting a message of the United States' supremacy. \"America's economy was in a rather dismal state,\" Mr. Trump said during a 30-minute speech to the world leaders and corporate titans gathered here. \"Before my presidency began, the outlook for many economies was bleak.\"Although the economy's recovery after its plummet was central to President Barack Obama's legacy, Mr. Trump said that his administration had created a \"roaring geyser of opportunity\" and proclaimed that \"the American dream is back bigger, better and stronger than ever before.\"Addressing a global audience, Mr. Trump delivered what amounted to a version of his campaign speech, speaking little of international alliances while playing up America's dominance in the world.At a conference that dedicated itself this year to climate change, Mr. Trump took a swipe at those demanding action. He announced that the United States would join an initiative to plant a trillion trees that was introduced at the event, but he also declared that \"we must reject the perennial prophets of doom\" and that it was \"not a time for pessimism.\"Former Vice President Al Gore, himself a leading climate change prophet, was seen leaving Mr. Trump's speech but declined to comment on the president's remarks.Mr. Trump's visit to Davos is his first foreign trip since Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent two articles of impeachment to the Senate and the first since he authorized the drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran's most powerful security commander. Many diplomats and analysts wondered if he would seem weakened abroad while his fate was being debated at home and how he would treat European leaders who have called his Iran strategy too provocative.Even if he did not show it, Mr. Trump surely kept an eye on developments back home. He did shoot out one Twitter message shortly before the Senate trial opened for the day: \"READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!\" he wrote, referring to records of two phone calls he had with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine -- transcripts that his critics have, in fact, read and consider evidence of misconduct even though he considers them \"perfect.\"But he gave little impression of being absorbed by either issue, at least not publicly. Arriving in Switzerland on Tuesday morning, he flew on Marine One over the Alps, from Zurich to Davos. The altitude increased the sense that the bitter partisan fight that would take place in the Capitol was a world away.As his motorcade made its way through twisty, snow-covered streets to the Davos Congress Center, nine Swiss tenors entertained the crowd with a version of \"Ranz des vaches,\" a mellifluous song for calling home cows -- and a more peaceful serenade than the songs that typically precede Mr. Trump's entrance at his rallies back home, like \"Macho Man\" by the Village People and \"Sympathy for the Devil\" by the Rolling Stones.Mr. Trump was also a more mellow version of himself.He highlighted the first phase of his trade deal with China and another with Mexico and Canada. And the audience appeared receptive, having warmed to him since he took office three years ago this week as they have benefited from his policies.\"Lev Parnas is not a topic of conversation at Davos,\" said Ian Bremmer, the president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political research and consulting firm, referring to a possible Senate trial witness.Still, television screens in Davos were filled with the face of a different Trump antagonist: the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was the other star speaker of the day. In her speech, she warned that \"our house is still on fire\" and that \"inaction is fueling the flames by the hour.\"Mr. Trump, who dismissed Ms. Thunberg when she was named Time magazine's person of the year, an honor he perennially covets, did not mention her by name in his own speech. But when he talked about the importance of clean water and clean air, he added that \"fear and doubt is not a good thought process.\"His speech also included false or exaggerated claims that seemed, at times, disconnected from the concerns of an international audience.\"I saved H.B.C.U.s. We saved them,\" Mr. Trump claimed, referring to historically black colleges and universities. \"They were going out and we saved them.\" Although the administration has increased investment in the schools by 14.3 percent, and although a number of them have struggled financially, there is no evidence that they were on the verge of extinction. In the past six years, one has closed and about 100 remain.Hanging over the conference was the question of whether the president would try to stage a surprise meeting with Mr. Zelensky, even though officials said the optics would be unhelpful to Mr. Trump. The president's trial centers on his efforts to coerce Mr. Zelensky to find incriminating information about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.In Davos, however, Mr. Trump may have found the right audience for support to counter the trial dominating the news at home. There was less anxiety about him rippling through the 1 percent set on Tuesday than when he originally attended the annual forum two years ago, fresh off an \"America First\" campaign filled with promises to rip up international agreements and alliances.This time, there was more concern about some of the progressive Democrats running to replace him. Through regulatory rollbacks, tax cuts and the success of the global economy, the president who ran as a populist has benefited many of the chief executives gathered at the event, even those who have taken public positions against some of his policies.\"There are lot of masters of the universe who think he may not be their cup of tea, but he's been a godsend,\" said Mr. Bremmer of the Eurasia Group. \"It's interesting to hear Mike Bloomberg saying he would fund Bernie Sanders's campaign if he won the nomination. Very few people here would say that.\"During Mr. Trump's career in New York real estate, entertainment and business, he never cracked the Davos set, whose Fortune 500 chief executives dismissed him as something of a gaudy sideshow.But the balance of power has shifted. And with progressives like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts emerging as top-tier possibilities for the Democratic presidential nomination, a crowd that once rejected Mr. Trump is now more willing to consider him one of its own.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump happily embraced them back. After his speech, he met with the International Business Council, and personally greeted every chief executive, according to attendees.The meeting was less about substance than socializing, one attendee said, as Mr. Trump grilled corporate leaders about whether they liked his speech. His daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also worked the room.Mr. Trump planned to meet separately with leaders of Iraq, Pakistan and the Kurdish regional government, as well as sit down with corporate chieftains.Shortly afterward, Mr. Trump headed to dinner with the corporate executives. Given a soccer ball by the head of FIFA -- \"a very beautiful, good-looking ball,\" Mr. Trump gushed -- the president then lavished praise on his guests, \"the greatest businessmen in the world.\"He drank in their praise in return, at the same moment that senators back home began debating how to try him for high crimes and misdemeanors.\"Africa loves you,\" Patrice Motsepe, a billionaire South African mining titan, told him.The president's staff was on message as well. When he introduced Larry Kudlow, his national economic adviser, Mr. Trump asked, \"How's the economy going?\"\"Pretty darn good, sir,\" Mr. Kudlow replied.\"He gave us the right answer,\" Mr. Trump said approvingly.Annie Karni and David Gelles reported from Davos Switzerland, and Peter Baker from Washington.

Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Vice President Mike Pence had a seat at the table. So did Robert O'Brien, the national security adviser, and Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary.But the White House aide whose portfolio is the Middle East was notably absent from the meeting.Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, was sitting for a photo shoot for a planned Time magazine cover story. He was also absent from the Situation Room later in the day when it was clear Iran was launching an attack on American forces and the same officials rush backed, joined by Mr. Trump and West Wing aides like Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, and Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary.Over the past two weeks, Mr. Kushner has had little visible part in what has been Mr. Trump's most high-stakes moment as commander in chief, the starkest example of how much his role in the White House is changing as the Trump presidency enters its fourth year.Mr. Kushner has also served as the peacemaker in trade negotiations with Mexico and China, smoothing over disputes and serving as a mediator between foreign officials and Mr. Trump. But with the North American trade deal expected to become law within weeks, and the president poised to sign a first-phase China trade deal on Wednesday, that role will be less of a focus.Instead, Mr. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, the president's older daughter, is positioning himself to be the overseer of something of even greater personal interest to his father-in-law: Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.Unlike the behind-the-scenes role he played in the 2016 campaign -- where he was seen as a key figure but, campaign aides said, never took a title and avoided blame -- Mr. Kushner is positioning himself now as the person officially overseeing the entire campaign from his office in the West Wing, organizing campaign meetings and making decisions about staffing and spending. His more prominent role comes after much of 2019 was spent bogged down by the Russia-related investigations that had dogged the president since he took office.The portfolio marks a sharp departure from Mr. Kushner's focus in the early days of the administration, when he sought to be a central driver of administration Middle East policy, acting at times as a shadow secretary of state who circumvented official channels of power within the State Department.Back then, Mr. Kushner's influence in the region extended far beyond his stated portfolio of negotiating peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, setting an early tone by bypassing cabinet members to persuade Mr. Trump to make Saudi Arabia his first stop abroad as president.\"Since Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has come in, you've seen Jared's role narrow to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, the director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, who worked under former Secretary of State John Kerry on Middle East issues. \"It's been a gradual move, and it's very striking right now.\"Mr. Kushner declined to comment on his change in focus, but his allies in the White House say he sees no reason to involve himself as extensively in international issues now that the State Department is run by Mr. Pompeo, whom he sees as far more competent than his predecessor, Rex W. Tillerson. They also pointed to the fact that Mr. Trump's national security team now includes many Kushner allies, like Mr. O'Brien and Brian H. Hook, the special representative for Iran who has also worked with Mr. Kushner on the peace process.Mr. Kushner's status as a member of the president's family has also made it possible for him to choose the moments and issues where his role is highly visible.He played a critical role in persuading Mr. Trump to support a criminal justice overhaul, which he has also promoted as a way to help Mr. Trump win over African-American voters. But he has never unveiled a peace plan whose delivery date has been delayed indefinitely. And with Israel in its own political limbo, the expectations that Mr. Kushner's plan would form the basis of a deal are low.In recent months, Mr. Kushner has been directing the construction of the president's wall along the southern border, telling associates he has a timetable for getting a portion completed by the election and holding regular meetings with status updates on how much mileage has been built. Mr. Kushner's wresting of control over the issue has generated criticism from some administration officials, who said he dives into other people's policy areas with abandon and little foresight.Last week, he was involved in the Trump campaign's decision to spend $10 million on a 60-second ad that will run during the Super Bowl, an announcement that came out after the campaign of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York signaled it would make the same buy, a person familiar with his role said.But ever since Mr. Trump entered office with his son-in-law at his side, Mr. Kushner has been trailed by questions about what it is that he really does or has accomplished. His portfolios -- streamlining the government's information technology systems, brokering peace in the Middle East -- have at times seemed so large that they are meaningless. His floating \"senior adviser\" status that functions outside of any formal chain of command has given him a role that seems simultaneously all-powerful and make-believe.His expectations for winning an election, however, are higher.During Mr. Trump's vacation at Mar-a-Lago, his private Florida club, Mr. Kushner arranged meetings with campaign officials to discuss messaging. He made a rare appearance at a campaign briefing in December with members of the news media, where the former Democrat declared that he was now a card-carrying Republican.Mr. Kushner spent the holidays with Mr. Trump, and it is unclear what private conversations he had with his father-in-law there about the situation in Iran. Mr. Trump, who personally granted his son-in-law a security clearance by overruling concerns flagged by intelligence officials and the White House counsel, often seeks Mr. Kushner's counsel on issues he is not directly involved with, and they spent many hours together during the week.Aides, however, would not say what Mr. Kushner's view of the strikes was.\"Jared's Middle East portfolio is primarily focused on developing a peace plan between the Israelis and the Palestinians,\" said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman. \"He gets involved in other matters where appropriate to further President Trump's objectives.\"While he was not in any Situation Room meetings, Mr. Kushner pushed his father-in-law to deliver some kind of statement about the Suleimani strike from the White House rather than at a political rally later, despite concerns from other senior officials about the president speaking about a crisis that did not appear to be over.And there are issues in the Middle East and on the international stage where Mr. Kushner still asserts himself: He was present for a meeting on Monday in the Oval Office with Khalid bin Salman, a member of the Saudi royal family. The meeting was not on Mr. Trump's schedule, and officials have declined to give a summary of what was discussed; its existence was acknowledged by the White House only after the Saudis posted photos on Twitter.After Mr. Trump met with the prime minister of Greece on Wednesday, it was Mr. Kushner he turned to in the Oval Office, an aide said, asking him to walk him out.Among Trump critics, Mr. Kushner's many roles have not instilled confidence. \"It seems like he just bounces around based on whatever issue intrigues him at any given moment, without regard for his past track record, or inexperience on any given issue,\" said Brian Fallon, Hillary Clinton's spokesman during her 2016 campaign against Mr. Trump.PhotographThe portfolio of Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, is shifting from matters like the Middle East to Mr. Trump's re-election.

But they argue that it doesn't merit his removal.WASHINGTON -- Even as they are set to acquit President Trump in his impeachment trial this week, Senate Republicans appear to be increasingly breaking with his defense that he did nothing wrong.On Sunday, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who was a key vote against calling witnesses in the Senate trial, expanded upon his criticism that Mr. Trump was \"crossing the line\" in his pressure campaign against Ukraine. And Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, who has remained a reliable defender of the president during his trial, called his actions \"not what I would have done.\"A day before the first contest of the 2020 election, two days before Mr. Trump's State of the Union address and three days before his expected acquittal, they and other Republicans appeared to be coalescing around a more nuanced argument: Mr. Trump's efforts to push Ukraine into investigating a political rival while withholding critical military aid might not have been appropriate. But that did not warrant the president's removal from office for the first time in American history.\"I think he shouldn't have done it -- I think it was wrong,\" Mr. Alexander said Sunday on \"Meet the Press\" on NBC. \"Inappropriate, was the way I'd say it. Improper, crossing the line. And then the only question left is: Who decides what to do about that?\"\"The people,\" he added. \"The people, is my conclusion.\"Mr. Alexander first took that position last week, when he announced that he would vote against the consideration of new witnesses and documents in Mr. Trump's trial. He acknowledged the merits of the House case for removing the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress: that the president had withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.But Mr. Alexander's decision was in part influenced by the proximity of the election. (When pressed about how he would have voted outside an election year, he said he most likely would have arrived at the same conclusion.)\"I don't think it's the kind of inappropriate action that the framers would expect the Senate to substitute its judgment for the people in picking a president,\" he said on Sunday.That argument has come under fire from Democrats, who say the nature of Mr. Trump's offense -- trying to persuade a foreign nation to interfere in the 2020 race -- could compromise the election.\"They need to remove him from office because he is threatening to still cheat in the next election by soliciting foreign interference,\" Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House impeachment manager, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" on CBS. \"And so the normal remedy for a president's misconduct isn't available here because the elections, he is already trying to prejudice and compromise with further foreign interference.\"The Republicans' argument also stands starkly at odds with what Mr. Trump -- who has deemed a phone call he had with Ukraine's president \"perfect\" and has resisted any suggestion that he acted improperly -- has demanded from his defenders.But Mr. Alexander's reasoning was echoed by multiple Republicans who voted against allowing new witnesses and documents in the impeachment trial. \"Lamar speaks for lots and lots of us,\" said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska.Among them is Ms. Ernst, who has repeatedly said the scrutiny over Hunter Biden's work for an energy company in Ukraine -- the basis for the investigation Mr. Trump had demanded -- could affect the presidential campaign of the elder Mr. Biden.\"I think, generally speaking, going after corruption would be the right thing to do; he did it maybe in the wrong manner,\" Ms. Ernst said Sunday on \"State of the Union\" on CNN. \"I think that he could have done it through different channels.\"But she added that \"whether you like what the president did or not,\" the charges did not clear the bar for removing him. \"Does it come to the point of removing a president from office?\" she said. \"I don't believe this does.\"Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said in a statement late last week that while some of Mr. Trump's actions were \"wrong and inappropriate,\" they did not \"rise to the level of removing a duly-elected president from office and taking him off the ballot in the middle of an election.\"\"Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a president from office,\" said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. (He later added on Twitter that he did not find either of the two articles of impeachment brought against Mr. Trump to be proved beyond a doubt.)Even one member of the president's defense team seemed to adopt a similar argument. As he continued to walk back remarks he made during the trial that suggested a president's actions in pursuit of re-election were inherently in the country's interest, Alan M. Dershowitz, the constitutional law scholar, said that actions that might be wrong might not be impeachable.\"On Election Day, as a citizen I will allow that to enter into my decision who to vote for. But it's not an impeachable offense,\" Mr. Dershowitz said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"I was there to argue a constitutional issue, not to tell people who to vote for, for president.\"With nine months left in the campaign, Mr. Alexander said he hoped that the consequences of Mr. Trump's phone call with Ukraine -- becoming the third American president to stand trial for high crimes and misdemeanors -- would resonate with the commander in chief.\"Enduring an impeachment is something no one should like,\" Mr. Alexander said. \"If a call like this gets you an impeachment, I would think he would think twice before he did it again.\"Chris Cameron contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Lamar Alexander, center right, said that voters should decide President Trump's fate.

Blair, replied that it would be possible, but not pretty. \"Expect Congress to become unhinged\" if the White House tried to countermand spending passed by the House and Senate, he wrote in a previously undisclosed email. And, he wrote, it might further fuel the narrative that Mr. Trump was pro-Russia.Mr. Blair was right, even if his prediction of a messy outcome was wildly understated. Mr. Trump's order to hold $391 million worth of sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, night vision goggles, medical aid and other equipment the Ukrainian military needed to fight a grinding war against Russian-backed separatists would help pave a path to the president's impeachment.The Democratic-led inquiry into Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine this spring and summer established that the president was actively involved in parallel efforts -- both secretive and highly unusual -- to bring pressure on a country he viewed with suspicion, if not disdain.One campaign, spearheaded by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, aimed to force Ukraine to conduct investigations that could help Mr. Trump politically, including one focused on a potential Democratic 2020 rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.The other, which unfolded nearly simultaneously but has gotten less attention, was the president's demand to withhold the security assistance. By late summer, the two efforts merged as American diplomats used the withheld aid as leverage in the effort to win a public commitment from the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to carry out the investigations Mr. Trump sought into Mr. Biden and unfounded or overblown theories about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election.Interviews with dozens of current and former administration officials, congressional aides and others, previously undisclosed emails and documents, and a close reading of thousands of pages of impeachment testimony provide the most complete account yet of the 84 days from when Mr. Trump first inquired about the money to his decision in September to relent.What emerges is the story of how Mr. Trump's demands sent shock waves through the White House and the Pentagon, created deep rifts within the senior ranks of his administration, left key aides like Mr. Mulvaney under intensifying scrutiny -- and ended only after Mr. Trump learned of a damning whistle-blower report and came under pressure from influential Republican lawmakers.In many ways, the havoc Mr. Giuliani and other Trump loyalists set off in the State Department by pursuing the investigations was matched by conflicts and confusion in the White House and Pentagon stemming from Mr. Trump's order to withhold the aid.Opposition to the order from his top national security advisers was more intense than previously known. In late August, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper joined Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser at the time, for a previously undisclosed Oval Office meeting with the president where they tried but failed to convince him that releasing the aid was in interests of the United States.By late summer, top lawyers at the Office of Management and Budget who had spoken to lawyers at the White House and the Justice Department in the weeks beforehand, were developing an argument -- not previously divulged publicly -- that Mr. Trump's role as commander in chief would simply allow him to override Congress on the issue.And Mr. Mulvaney is shown to have been deeply involved as a key conduit for transmitting Mr. Trump's demands for the freeze across the administration.The interviews and documents show how Mr. Trump used the bureaucracy to advance his agenda in the face of questions about its propriety and even legality from officials in the White House budget office and the Pentagon, many of whom say they were kept in the dark about the president's motivations and had grown used to convention-flouting requests from the West Wing. One veteran budget official who raised questions about the legal justification was pushed aside.Those carrying out Mr. Trump's orders on the aid were for the most part operating in different lanes from those seeking the investigations, including Mr. Giuliani and a number of senior diplomats, including Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, the State Department's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.The New York Times found that some key players are now offering a defense that they did not know the diplomatic push for the investigations was playing out at the same time they were implementing the aid freeze -- or if they were aware of both channels, they did not connect the two.Mr. Mulvaney is said by associates to have stepped out of the room whenever Mr. Trump would talk with Mr. Giuliani to preserve Mr. Trump's attorney-client privilege, leaving him with limited knowledge about their efforts regarding Ukraine. Mr. Mulvaney has told associates he learned of the substance of Mr. Trump's July 25 call weeks after the fact.Yet testimony before the House suggests a different picture. Fiona Hill, a top deputy to Mr. Bolton at the time, told the impeachment inquiry about a July 10 White House meeting at which Mr. Sondland said Mr. Mulvaney had guaranteed that Mr. Zelensky would be invited to the White House if the Ukrainians agreed to the investigations -- an arrangement that Mr. Bolton described as a \"drug deal,\" according to Ms. Hill.Along with Mr. Bolton and others, Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Blair have declined to cooperate with impeachment investigators and provide information to Congress under oath, an intensifying point of friction between the two parties as the Senate prepares for Mr. Trump's impeachment trial.At the center of the maelstrom was the Office of Management and Budget, a seldom-scrutinized arm of the White House that during the Trump administration has often had to find creative legal reasoning to justify the president's unorthodox policy proposals, like his demand to divert Pentagon funding to his proposed wall along the border with Mexico.In the Ukraine case, however, shock about the president's decision spread across America's national security apparatus -- from the National Security Council to the State Department and the Pentagon. By September, after the freeze had become public and scrutiny was increasing, the blame game inside the administration was in full swing.On Sept. 10, the day before Mr. Trump changed his mind, a political appointee at the budget office, Michael P. Duffey, wrote a lengthy email to the Pentagon's top budget official, with whom he had been at odds throughout the summer about how long the agency could withhold the aid.He asserted that the Defense Department had the authority to do more to ensure that the aid could be released to Ukraine by the congressionally mandated deadline of the end of that month, suggesting that responsibility for any failure should not rest with the White House.Forty-three minutes later, the Pentagon official, Elaine McCusker, hit send on a brief but stinging reply.\"You can't be serious,\" she wrote. \"I am speechless.\"'We Need to Hold It Up'For top officials inside the budget office, the first warning came on June 19.Informed that the president had a problem with the aid, Mr. Blair called Russell T. Vought, the acting head of the Office of Management and Budget. \"We need to hold it up,\" he said, according to officials briefed about the conversation.Typical of the Trump White House, the inquiry was not born of a rigorous policy process. Aides speculated that someone had shown Mr. Trump a news article about the Ukraine assistance and he demanded to know more.Mr. Vought and his team took to Google, and came upon a piece in the conservative Washington Examiner saying that the Pentagon would pay for weapons and other military equipment for Ukraine, bringing American security aid to the country to $1.5 billion since 2014.The money, the article noted, was coming at a critical moment: Mr. Zelensky, a onetime comedian, had called ending the armed conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine his top priority -- a move that would likely only happen if he could negotiate from a position of strength.The budget office officials had little idea of why Mr. Trump was interested in the topic, but many of the president's more senior aides were well aware of his feelings about Ukraine. Weeks earlier, in an Oval Office meeting on May 23, with Mr. Sondland, Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Blair in attendance, Mr. Trump batted away assurances that Mr. Zelensky was committed to confronting corruption.\"They are all corrupt, they are all terrible people,\" Mr. Trump said, according to testimony in the impeachment inquiry.The United States had been planning to provide $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine in two chunks: $250 million allocated by the Pentagon for war-fighting equipment -- from sniper rifles to rocket-propelled grenade launchers -- and $141 million controlled by the State Department to buy night-vision devices, radar systems and yet more rocket-grenade launchers.With the money having been appropriated by Congress, it would be hard for the administration to keep it from being spent by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.The task of dealing with the president's demands fell primarily to a group of political appointees in the West Wing and the budget office, most with personal and professional ties to Mr. Mulvaney. There was no public announcement that Mr. Trump wanted the assistance withheld. Neither Congress nor the Ukrainian government was formally notified.Mr. Mulvaney had first served in the administration as the budget director, after three terms in the House, where he earned a reputation as a firebrand conservative.The four top political appointees helping Mr. Mulvaney execute the hold -- Mr. Vought, Mr. Blair, Mr. Duffey and Mark Paoletta, the budget office's top lawyer -- all had extensive experience in either congressional budget politics or Republican and conservative causes.Their efforts would cause tension and at times conflict between officials at the budget office and the Pentagon, some of whom watched with growing alarm.A Question of LegalityThe single largest chunk of the federal government's annual discretionary budget, some $800 billion a year, goes to the Pentagon, spy agencies and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The career official in charge of managing the flow of all that money for the budget office is an Afghanistan war veteran named Mark Sandy.After learning about the president's June 19 request, Mr. Sandy contacted the Pentagon to learn more about the aid package. He also repeatedly pressed Mr. Duffey about why Mr. Trump had imposed the hold in the first place.\"He didn't provide an explicit response on the reason,\" Mr. Sandy testified in the impeachment inquiry. \"He simply said we need to let the hold take place -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- and then revisit this issue with the president.\"From the start, budget office officials took the position that the money did not have to go out the door until the end of September, giving them time to address the president's questions.It was easy enough for the White House to hold up the State Department portion of the funding. Since the State Department had not yet notified Congress of its plans to release the money, all it took was making sure that the notification did not happen.Freezing the Pentagon's $250 million portion was more difficult, since the Pentagon had already certified that Ukraine had met requirements set by Congress to show that it was addressing its endemic corruption and notified lawmakers of its intent to spend the money.So on July 19, Mr. Duffey proposed an unusual solution: Mr. Sandy should attach a footnote to a routine budget document saying the money was being temporarily withheld.Approving such requests is routine; Mr. Sandy processed hundreds each year. But attaching a footnote to block spending that the administration had already notified Congress was ready to go was not. Mr. Sandy said in testimony that he had never done it before in his 12 years at the agency.And there was a problem with this maneuver: Mr. Sandy was concerned it might violate a law called the Impoundment Control Act that protects Congress's spending power and prohibits the administration from blocking disbursement of the aid unless it notifies Congress.\"I asked about the duration of the hold and was told there was not clear guidance on that,\" Mr. Sandy testified. \"So that is what prompted my concern.\"Mr. Sandy sought advice from the top lawyers at the budget office.A Pivotal DayFor a full month, the fact that Mr. Trump wanted to halt the aid remained confined primarily to a small group of officials.That ended on July 18, when a group of top administration officials meeting on Ukraine policy -- including some calling in from Kyiv -- learned from a midlevel budget office official that the president had ordered the aid frozen.\"I and the others on the call sat in astonishment,\" William B. Taylor Jr., the top United States diplomat in Ukraine, testified to House investigators. \"In an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.\"That same day, aides on the House Foreign Affairs Committee received four calls from administration sources warning them about the hold and urging them to look into it.A week later came Mr. Trump's fateful July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Bolton, the national security adviser, had recommended the call take place in an effort to end the \"incessant lobbying\" from officials like Mr. Sondland that the two leaders connect.Some of Mr. Trump's aides had thought the call might lead Mr. Trump to lift the freeze. But Mr. Trump did not specifically mention the hold, and instead asked Mr. Zelensky to look into Mr. Biden and his son and into supposed Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election. Among those listening on the call was Mr. Blair.Mr. Blair has told associates he did not make much of Mr. Trump's requests during the call for the investigations. He saw the aid freeze not as a political tool, but as an extension of Mr. Trump's general aversion to foreign aid and his belief that Ukraine is rife with corruption.Just 90 minutes after the call ended, and following days of email traffic on the topic, Mr. Duffey, Mr. Sandy's boss, sent out a new email to the Pentagon, where officials were impatient about getting the money out the door. His message was clear: Do not spend it.\"Given the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your keeping that information closely held to those who need to know to execute the direction,\" Mr. Duffey wrote in his note, which was released this month to the Center for Public Integrity.This caused immediate discomfort at the Pentagon, with a top official there noting that this hold on military assistance was coming on the same day Ukraine announced it had seized a Russian tanker -- a potential escalation in the conflict between the two nations.On that same day, Mr. Sandy, having received the go-ahead from the budget office's lawyers, took the first official step to legally impose what they called a \"brief pause,\" inserting a footnote into the budget document that prohibited the Pentagon from spending any of the aid until Aug. 5.By that point, officials in Ukraine were getting word that something was up. At the same time, the effort to win a commitment from the Ukrainians for the investigations sought by Mr. Trump was intensifying, with Mr. Giuliani and a Zelensky aide, Andriy Yermak, meeting in Madrid on Aug. 2 and the diplomats Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker also working the issue.And inside the intelligence community, a C.I.A. officer was hearing talk about the two strands of pressure on Ukraine, including the aid freeze. Seeing how they fit together, he was alarmed enough that by Aug. 12 he would take the extraordinary step of laying them out in detail in a confidential whistle-blower complaint.A 'POTUS-level Decision'Keeping a hold on the assistance was now a top priority, so officials moved to tighten control over the money.In a very unusual step, the White House removed Mr. Sandy's authority to oversee the aid freeze. The job was handed in late July to Mr. Sandy's boss, Mr. Duffey, the political appointee, the official ultimately responsible for apportionments but one who had little experience in the nuts and bolts of the budget office process.As the debate over the aid continued, disagreements flared. Two budget office staff members left the agency after the summer. Mr. Sandy testified that their departures were related to the aid freeze, a statement disputed by budget office officials.Pentagon officials, in the dark about the reason for the holdup, grew increasingly frustrated. Ms. McCusker, the powerful Pentagon budget official, notified the budget office that either $61 million of the money would have to be spent by Monday, Aug. 12 or it would be lost. The budget office saw her threat as a ploy to force release of the aid.At the White House, which had been looped into the dispute by the budget office, there was a growing consensus that officials could find a legal rationale for continuing the hold, but with the Monday deadline looming, it was a \"POTUS-level decision,\" one official said.Complicating matters, another budget battle was escalating. Mr. Vought was attempting to impose cuts of as much as $4 billion on the nation's overall foreign aid budget. It was an entirely separate initiative from the Ukraine freeze, and was quickly abandoned, but helped the White House establish that its concern about aid was not limited to Ukraine.By the second week of August, Mr. Duffey had taken to issuing footnotes every few days to block the Pentagon spending. Office of Management and Budget lawyers approved each one.Mr. Trump spent the weekend before the Pentagon's Aug. 12 deadline at Bedminster, his New Jersey golf resort.In a previously unreported sequence of events, Mr. Mulvaney worked to schedule a call for that day with Mr. Trump and top aides involved in the freeze, including Mr. Vought, Mr. Bolton and Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel. But they waited to set a final time because Mr. Trump had a golf game planned for Monday morning with John Daly, the flamboyant professional golfer, and they did not know how long it would take.Late that morning, Ms. McCusker checked in with the budget office. \"Hey, any update for us?\" she asked in an email obtained by Center for Public Integrity.Mr. Duffey was still waiting for an answer as of late that afternoon. \"Elaine -- I don't have an update,\" he wrote back. \"I am attempting to get one.\"The planned-for conference call with the president never happened. Budget office lawyers decided that Ms. McCusker had inaccurately raised alarms about the Aug. 12 date to try to force their hand.In Bedminster with Mr. Trump, Mr. Mulvaney finally reached the president and the answer was clear: Mr. Trump wanted the freeze kept in place. In Washington, the whistle-blower submitted his report that same day.The National Security Team IntervenesInside the administration, pressure was mounting on Mr. Trump to reverse himself.Backed by a memo saying the National Security Council, the Pentagon and the State Department all wanted the aid released, Mr. Bolton made a personal appeal to Mr. Trump on Aug. 16, but was rebuffed.On Aug. 28, Politico published a story reporting that the assistance to Ukraine had been frozen. After more than two months, the issue, the topic of fiery internal debate, was finally public.Mr. Bolton's relationship with the president had been deteriorating for months, and he would leave the White House weeks later, but on this front he had powerful internal allies.On a sunny, late-August day, Mr. Bolton, Mr. Esper and Mr. Pompeo arrayed themselves around the Resolute desk in the Oval Office to present a united front, the leaders of the president's national security team seeking to convince him face to face that freeing up the money for Ukraine was the right thing to do. One by one they made their case.\"This is in America's interest,\" Mr. Bolton argued, according to one official briefed on the gathering.\"This defense relationship, we have gotten some really good benefits from it,\" Mr. Esper added, noting that most of the money was being spent on military equipment made in the United States.Mr. Trump responded that he did not believe Mr. Zelensky's promises of reform. He emphasized his view that corruption remained endemic and repeated his position that European nations needed to do more for European defense.\"Ukraine is a corrupt country,\" the president said. \"We are pissing away our money.\"The aid remained blocked. On Aug. 31, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, arranged a call with Mr. Trump. Mr. Johnson had been told days earlier by Mr. Sondland that the aid would be unblocked only if the Ukrainians gave Mr. Trump the investigations he wanted.When Mr. Johnson asked Mr. Trump directly if the aid was contingent on getting a commitment to pursue the investigations, Mr. Johnson later said, Mr. Trump replied, amid a string of expletives, that there was no such demand and he would never do such a thing.Around the same time, White House lawyers informed Mr. Trump about the whistle-blower's complaint regarding his pressure campaign. It is not clear how much detail the lawyers provided the president about the details of the complaint, which noted the aid freeze.Mr. Trump was scheduled to travel to Poland on Sept. 1 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, and had planned to get together with Mr. Zelensky. Some administration officials hoped meeting the new Ukrainian president in person would change Mr. Trump's mind.But a hurricane was bearing down on the United States, and Mr. Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence in his place. When Mr. Zelensky raised the issue with the vice president, Mr. Pence said he should speak with Mr. Trump.Behind the scenes in Warsaw, Mr. Sondland, the American envoy who was Mr. Trump's point person on getting the Ukrainians to agree to the investigations, had a blunter message. Until the Ukrainians publicly announced the investigations, he told Mr. Yermak, the Zelensky adviser, they should not expect to get the military aid. (Mr. Yermak has questioned Mr. Sondland's account.)An Abrupt ReversalBy late summer, top lawyers at the budget office were developing a proposed legal justification for the hold, based in part on conversations with White House lawyers as well as the Justice Department.Their argument was that lifting the hold would undermine Mr. Trump's negotiating position in his efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine.The president, the lawyers believed, could ignore the requirements of the Impoundment Control Act and continue to hold the aid by asserting constitutional commander in chief powers that give him authority over diplomacy. He could do so, they believed, if he determined that, based on existing circumstances, releasing the money would undermine military or diplomatic efforts.But divisions within the administration continued to widen; Mr. Bolton was opposed to using an argument proffered by administration lawyers to block the funding. And pressure from Congress was intensifying. Mr. Johnson and another influential Republican, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, were both pushing for the aid to be released.On a call with Mr. Portman on Sept. 11, Mr. Trump repeated his familiar refrain about other nations not doing enough to support Ukraine.\"Sure, I agree with you,\" Mr. Portman responded, according to an aide who described the exchange. \"But we should not hold that against Ukraine. We need to release these funds.\"Democrats in the House were gearing up to limit Mr. Trump's power to hold up the money to Ukraine, and the chairmen of three House committees had also announced on Sept. 9 that they were opening an investigation.Still, White House officials did not expect anything to change, especially since Mr. Trump had repeatedly rejected the advice of his national security team.But then, just as suddenly as the hold was imposed, it was lifted. Mr. Trump, apparently unwilling to wage a public battle, told Mr. Portman he would let the money go.White House aides rushed to notify their counterparts at the Pentagon and elsewhere. The freeze had been lifted. The money could be spent. Get it out the door, they were told.The debate would now begin as to why the hold was lifted, with Democrats confident they knew the answer.\"I have no doubt about why the president allowed the assistance to go forward,\" said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"He got caught.\"Adam Goldman, Edward Wong and Peter Baker contributed reporting.PhotographMick Mulvaney (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A1); Among the players in the campaign to withhold funds from Ukraine were, clockwise from top left: Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Volodymyr Zelensky, the newly elected Ukrainian president; Russell Vought, the acting head of Office of Management and Budget; and President Trump.

But his vote last week to convict Mr. Trump of impeachable offenses has eclipsed all of that, earning him the rage of a president who coveted a bipartisan acquittal.In the days since Mr. Manchin, a West Virginian who was one of the few swing votes on impeachment, supported Mr. Trump's removal, the president has laced into the senator with a zeal that is startling even by his standards.He called Mr. Manchin a \"puppet Democrat Senator\" who was \"weak & pathetic.\" He gave the senator a new nickname: \"Joe Munchkin.\" He suggested that Mr. Manchin was too stupid to understand a transcript of his telephone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the central piece of evidence in the case. And to add insult to injury, he took credit for the senator's signature legislative achievement: a bipartisan bill to secure miners' pensions.On Monday, Mr. Manchin made clear that he had had enough.\"The people of America and the people of West Virginia want some adults in the room,\" he said in an interview, but he said that Mr. Trump was not behaving like one. Then, the senator -- who at 6-foot-3 is roughly the same height as Mr. Trump, though considerably thinner -- took his own shot.\"Munchkin means that you're small, right?\" he said. \"I'm bigger than him -- of course he has me by weight, now, he has more volume than I have by about 30 or 40 pounds. I'm far from being weak and pathetic, and I'm far from being a munchkin, and I still want him to succeed as president of the United States.\"Mr. Trump's litany of insults reflects his dashed hopes of counting a Democratic defector among his supporters on impeachment, a crucial piece of the president's claims that impeachment was a partisan \"hoax\" so extreme that it had no legitimacy. And it underscores his disappointment that Mr. Manchin, who has at times broken with his party to support parts of the president's agenda, refused to back him during this particular fight. Given the politics of West Virginia, a state Mr. Trump won with 68 percent of the vote in 2016, Mr. Manchin was among a very small group of Democrats who were seen as possible votes to acquit.But Mr. Manchin said he did not base his choice on electoral politics.\"I knew the politics of my state,\" the senator said. \"If I was going to make a political decision, I'd have voted to acquit.\"Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the only Republican to vote to convict Mr. Trump, said much the same thing, and has been relegated to Mr. Trump's enemies list as a result.\"The president is entitled to say whatever he thinks,\" Mr. Romney said on Monday in a brief hallway interview in the Capitol. \"I'm not going to try to direct what he says.\"Democrats accused Mr. Trump of abusing his oath of office and obstructing Congress by trying to get Ukraine to help him win re-election and then covering up his actions. Central to the case was the phone call in which he asked Mr. Zelensky to \"do us a favor though\" and investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.Days before the final verdict in the impeachment trial, Mr. Manchin stood up in a closed-door lunch with his Democratic colleagues and delivered an impassioned speech about the dilemma he faced.He was struggling, Mr. Manchin told his colleagues, and quoted from a statement made by Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who spent more than half a century in the Senate until his death in 2010. During President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Mr. Byrd warned that the Senate might sink \"further into the mire because of this partisanship.\"There was some applause and very little pushback, according to two people with knowledge of the exchange. Mr. Manchin, who has long prided himself on working across party lines, later repeated Mr. Byrd's words on the Senate floor, warning that \"there will be no winners on this vote.\"In that sense, he was right; the vote has certainly not been a winner for him.\"It has been incredibly hot,\" said Hoppy Kercheval, a conservative West Virginia talk show host, describing the reaction to Mr. Manchin's vote. \"I got more texts about Manchin's vote than anything I've talked about in a year -- most of them angry and some of them unrepeatable.\"Mr. Manchin, a former governor, has long had a reputation for bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. According to the website FiveThirtyEight, Mr. Manchin has voted with Mr. Trump 53 percent of the time. His votes, though, are hard to predict.At the outset of the administration, Mr. Trump courted Mr. Manchin and tried to persuade him to become a Republican. But Mr. Manchin stuck with Democrats in voting against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and against Mr. Trump's tax bill. Then he crossed party lines to become the lone Democratic vote in favor of confirming Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Some Democrats said Mr. Manchin's guilty vote on impeachment surprised them. He had floated the possibility of a censure in the days before the final vote. In the interview, he said he thought it might be a way to get some bipartisan consensus that Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky was hardly \"perfect,\" as the president had repeatedly said.\"I don't think there was a person among those 100 senators who believed the president had a perfect phone call and didn't do anything wrong. I believe they all know something was wrong,\" he said. \"I thought censure would be the way we could get a majority of the vote, and I couldn't even get one Republican to sign on.\"Mike Plante, a Democratic strategist in West Virginia, said he took the talk of censure as an indication that Mr. Manchin was thinking of voting to acquit.\"People were pleasantly surprised and happy that he took this step,\" Mr. Plante said, referring to Democrats. \"He clearly recognized that this was more than politics as usual. This was history, and he did not miss that moment.\"But Nick Casey, the former chairman of the West Virginia Democratic Party and a close Manchin ally, said he was not surprised. \"Joe has never been shy about going into the belly of the beast if he does something that he is very comfortable with. And if people disagree with him, that's their right. He got elected to make decisions, and he made one.\"His vote caused a bit of a dust-up between Mr. Manchin and the state's other senator, Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican. In an interview on Fox News last week, she said the vote was \"not being received well here at home\" and said that Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, had probably \"just pulled the noose a little tight and said, 'Come on, everybody, we're going to jump off this cliff together.\"'The suggestion rankled Mr. Manchin, who made his own appearance on Fox News the next day to push back. \"Shelley knows me well enough that no one can pull my chain, tie a noose around me or any of that.\"In the Capitol on Monday, Ms. Capito -- and many other Republicans -- said they had no interest in getting in the middle of a dispute between Mr. Trump and Mr. Manchin.\"That's between him and the president,\" she said. \"I don't agree with Joe's vote -- he knows that -- but everybody's entitled to their opinion and I just think we need to move on.\"At 72, Mr. Manchin, who won re-election narrowly in 2018, has not said whether he will run again in 2024. Mr. Plante said his vote to convict the president could make it harder for him to do so. But Mr. Manchin says he is comfortable with his decision.\"I've only taken two oaths since I've been a senator,\" he said. \"One was to protect and defend the Constitution and the other was to do impartial justice, and I think I did. I can sleep on that.\"Nicholas Fandos and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a swing vote on impeachment, drew President Trump's fury after the trial ended.

President Trump is learning it the hard way this week.He is, in effect, experiencing the downside of having spent the last three years personalizing much of what happens in the markets and the economy, saying that the soaring stock values under his watch are a reflection of his special ability, and a central part of his case for re-election in November.Most presidents avoid boasting about a rising stock market because they know how fragile it is, and how little control over stock prices they really have, and how stock prices can move sharply for reasons outside their control, or sometimes for no clear reason at all.The cost of claiming personal credit for stock market gains comes when you get stock market losses. And that is particularly relevant after an 8 percent drop in the S&P 500 since its peak last Wednesday, seemingly caused by a recognition on Wall Street that the spread of coronavirus could disrupt the world economy.\"I think the stock market is something I know a lot about,\" President Trump said in a news conference Wednesday evening. \"I think the stock market will recover. The economy is very strong.\" He also said the stock market decline was partly a result of the Democratic presidential candidates' rhetoric on the debate stage on Tuesday.The outbreak of the new type of coronavirus in China and its spread to other nations was not something Mr. Trump could have prevented. But even as public health officials start to warn that many Americans may become infected, the Trump administration has devoted lots of effort to talking up the stock market.\"Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\" the president tweeted shortly after the market closed Monday afternoon after a 3.5 percent drop.It went on to drop an additional 3 percent on Tuesday and 0.4 percent Wednesday.Wednesday morning, President Trump seemingly blamed the stock market sell-off on alarmist coverage by cable news networks and said the country was in great shape.If the sell-off continues, it could undermine a key pillar of the president's re-election pitch. That might be less of an issue if Mr. Trump had not so frequently spoken of the stock market as a real-time barometer of his presidency's success.But there's more at stake than public relations. There's also the risk that the administration's focus on the optics of the market distracts them from the bigger task at hand -- trying to protect against the potential spread of disease and loss of life that would accompany a global pandemic.Ideally, even economic officials who don't have expertise in disease transmission would spend their time trying to understand what industries are likely to be heavily affected and whether government can do anything to help them work through the supply chain disruptions and other bad effects of the virus.Tuesday afternoon, the chief White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was interviewed on CNBC in the midst of the sell-off, and focused on talking up the markets.\"The virus story is not going to last forever,\" he said on \"The Exchange.\" \"To me, if you are an investor out there and you have a long-term point of view, I would suggest very seriously taking a look at the market; the stock market, that is a lot cheaper than it was a week or two ago.\"He then proceeded to suggest that fears that the virus would spread and cause major damage to the U.S. economy were misplaced.\"We have contained this,\" Mr. Kudlow said. \"I won't say airtight, but it's pretty close to airtight.\"That's not what public health officials said, in a briefing that same afternoon.\"It's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,\" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\"We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this could be bad,\" she added.The effort to set an optimistic tone on the markets was clearly at cross-purposes with what public health officials see as necessary to minimize the damage from a potential pandemic.\"It's understandable that the administration, in an election year, is focused on keeping the stock market and the economy strong,\" said Michael Steel, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and former spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. \"But they risk creating the impression that they're more focused on the economic impact of the virus than effective public health measures.\"Then there is the broader question of credibility. During the global financial crisis in 2008, White House and Treasury officials were acutely aware that if they seemed too boosterish in public comments on the crisis, it would undermine their credibility and the sense in markets that they were taking the threat seriously enough.When the government announces some important good news toward resolving a crisis -- whether it's that banks have adequate capital or that a pandemic has been contained -- you want people to believe it, which they will do only if the same government has been upfront about the realities of that crisis to begin with. Neither the president's tweets nor Mr. Kudlow's interviews suggest this administration is overly worried about this idea.Imagine a company facing a major crisis, like a safety recall of its products, which in turn causes a plunging stock price.If the executive team devoted all its energy to going on TV to complain about the falling stock price, it probably wouldn't do much good. If the team instead ignored the stock price for a while and tried to fix the safety problem and show consumers that the company was reliable, it still might take a while for the stock to recover, but eventually it probably would.The risk for the United States is that the Trump administration, given election-year politics and the president's penchant for personalizing the markets, follows something more like the first strategy.PhotographPresident Trump attributes market gains to his policies. When the virus caused losses, he blamed Democrats and news outlets.

It was his second rally in three nights.In a state where the Democratic field faces a competitive and critical contest on Monday night, the president told his supporters that they had a \"front-row seat to the lunacy and the madness of a totally sick left.\" He called the Democrats the party of \"socialism and blatant corruption,\" even as he sits accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.Unlike the Democrats, Mr. Trump does not face a competitive contest in Iowa, where his two Republican challengers -- Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and Bill Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts -- have failed to make any dent in Mr. Trump's support.But the Trump campaign views a show of force before the caucuses as an opportunity to try to slow any momentum the winning Democrat hopes to gain from the close race. And Mr. Trump's team is seeking to build excitement ahead of the first chance voters have had to show their support for the president since the 2016 election.Mr. Trump tried to belittle his Democratic opponents on Thursday with his signature nicknames, referring to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as \"Sleepy Joe,\" Senator Bernie Sanders as \"Crazy Bernie\" and Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, as \"Mini Mike.\" He poked fun multiple times at the pronunciation of the name of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and accused the field at large of \"glorifying illegal immigration.\"Four years after voters first saw Mr. Trump's name on a ballot, he leaned into some of the original, fear-mongering themes that defined his entry into politics, calling undocumented immigrants \"stone cold rapists.\" The line was a callback to his kickoff speech in 2015, when he said of undocumented immigrants: \"They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\"Mr. Trump seemed aware that he was rocketing into a state where Democrats have been camped out for months, noting that \"we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street.\"But his focus on the Democratic field in front of him appeared to be divided by his political enemies of the past and his foils in Congress.The president reminisced about the 2016 election, expressing a longing for the former Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and rehashing a four-year-old campaign gaffe where she described some of his supporters as \"deplorables.\"\"Maybe we take another crack at Crazy Hillary,\" Mr. Trump said. \"She was so easy.\"And he broke up his re-election pitch with invective aimed at Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, whom the president referred to as a \"sick puppy,\" and a diatribe against Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom he accused of letting her district in San Francisco fall into decay.\"We're having probably the best years we've ever had, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people?\" Mr. Trump said. But he claimed it was still a \"happy period because we call it 'impeachment light.\"'\"This is not easy,\" he said, \"you got maniacs doing a number on you for three years.\"Mr. Trump spoke as the Senate waited on Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a close friend of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to announce his decision on whether to support hearing from witnesses during the impeachment trial. A couple of hours after Mr. Trump left the stage, Mr. Alexander said he was a \"no\" on hearing from more witnesses. His is a critical vote, and his decision will help determine whether Mr. Trump receives a swift acquittal as soon as Friday.Trump officials said the caucus on Monday, even if it was not competitive, would be an important milestone for a campaign that has essentially been going on since Mr. Trump's famous escalator ride in Trump Tower in 2015. \"This will be the first time his supporters are able to take part in the process that begins his re-election,\" said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman.Before the rally on Thursday night at Drake University, Mr. Trump made a brief stop in Warren, Mich., where he spoke to manufacturing workers the day after he signed the revised North American Free Trade Agreement into law.Mr. Trump's trade deals are a key part of his re-election message. But it was clear that the impeachment trial -- which Republican senators are hoping to wrap up quickly without hearing from additional witnesses like John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser -- was on his mind.\"I've kept my promise, not only my promise of loving the people of Michigan, but my promise of taking care of it so other countries aren't ripping us off,\" Mr. Trump told the crowd gathered at Dana Inc., a major auto parts manufacturer of axles, transmissions and other key components in Warren, an industrial city north of Detroit. \"You remember the tax cut? It was the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and what do they do? They impeach you. It's frankly a disgrace to our country.\"The Trump campaign plans to follow up on the Des Moines rally with a blitz of appearances at caucus sites on Monday by roughly 80 cabinet secretaries, administration officials and members of Congress to generate enthusiasm among Iowa Republicans.Mr. Biden on Thursday spent significant time during campaign stops in Iowa marveling at the band of Trump surrogates and supporters planning to flood the state, suggesting it was proof Mr. Trump's campaign was running scared. \"I never saw another party have so much interest in, in a Democratic caucus,\" he said. \"I wonder why they're all coming. I wonder why they're here.\"Mr. Trump already has deep support in Iowa, a state he won in 2016 by more than nine points. Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, has been a strong Trump supporter who has echoed the president's description of a Democratic Party defined by \"left-wing nuts.\" Campaign officials have tried to reward Mr. Kaufmann's loyalty with presidential visits intended to motivate other state chairmen to follow suit.The president last held a campaign rally in Iowa in Council Bluffs in October 2018 as part of his push before the midterm elections. In June, he traveled to the state to speak at the Iowa Republican dinner on the same day that Mr. Biden was crisscrossing the state, giving voters a preview of what a general election matchup between the two would look like.Since then, however, Mr. Biden has slipped from his front-runner status in the state, where Mr. Sanders has emerged on top in a handful of polls. But Mr. Sanders as well Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado spent the day in the Senate chamber.Steve Friess contributed reporting from Warren, Mich., and Katie Glueck from Des Moines.PhotographPresident Trump on Thursday at a rally in Des Moines.

Bolton, the former national security adviser whose forthcoming book pokes holes in President Trump's impeachment defense, the newest Republican member of the United States Senate rushed to publicly side with Mr. Trump.Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, who is all of a month into her job, lashed out at one of her fellow Republicans, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, for pressing to subpoena Mr. Bolton, accusing her colleague of wanting to \"appease the left by calling witnesses who will slander the @realDonaldTrump during their 15 minutes of fame.\"\"The circus is over,\" she added in a post on the president's favorite platform, Twitter. \"It's time to move on.\"The attack on Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee whom Mr. Trump has berated as a \"pompous 'ass\"' and a \"fool,\" reflected how Ms. Loeffler, who arrived on Capitol Hill just in time for the third Senate presidential impeachment trial in history, is managing her new role as she faces intense political headwinds of her own.In the courtly Senate, novice members typically take their time before jumping into the spotlight, keeping to themselves as they set up their offices and learn the archaic rules of the institution. But Ms. Loeffler, who had never held public office when she was appointed last year to serve out the term of Senator Johnny Isakson, is breaking convention as she works to use the extraordinary circumstances of the impeachment battle to solidify her place in a party where loyalty to Mr. Trump is the key to survival.Hours after she tweeted on Monday, associates close to Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee and a close ally of Mr. Trump's, told reporters he would challenge her for her seat in November. His candidacy, which had long been rumored, helped to explain why Ms. Loeffler, who was appointed over Mr. Trump's explicit objections -- he preferred Mr. Collins for the job -- raced to broadcast her support for the president in the impeachment fight.\"Republican primaries these days have become contests about who loves President Trump more,\" said Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican political consultant. \"Mr. Collins has been one of the president's most vociferous defenders. That puts Senator Loeffler in a position of vocally demonstrating that she has the president's back in the impeachment debate.\"Sworn in days after Mr. Trump authorized the drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran's top security commander, Ms. Loeffler began work as the country found itself on the edge of war and the brink of the historic impeachment trial.\"It's going to be a total immersion,\" said Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia. \"She's not only got to become a full-fledged voting senator here with an office here and an office in the state, she's got to put a campaign together.\"Her orientation to the Senate has mostly consisted of long afternoons at her desk in the chamber listening to House Democrats spar with Mr. Trump's legal team over whether to remove him from office. But Ms. Loeffler, a wealthy Atlanta-based financial executive and Republican donor, has made a point of letting her constituents know that is not her primary focus.\"I wanted to let you know I am keeping farmer's hours,\" Ms. Loeffler told her constituents in a video posted to her Twitter account last week. \"So even though we've had late nights here with the impeachment trial, I'm making sure I'm working hard for Georgia and not getting distracted by this impeachment.\" (A spokeswoman for Ms. Loeffler declined to make her available for an interview.)Ms. Loeffler, a former collegiate basketball player with a curtain of blond hair that falls to the middle of her back, cuts an unusual figure in the Senate, particularly in the overwhelmingly male Republican conference. During her second week on the job in the Capitol, a police officer stopped Ms. Loeffler on her way to a weekly Republican lunch and asked for identification, prompting a sharp correction from an aide.To Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, that was precisely the point of selecting her to serve out the term of Mr. Isakson, who retired in December because of an illness. Mr. Kemp was betting that Ms. Loeffler could appeal to a critical bloc of suburban, moderate voters -- especially women -- whose support the party has struggled to maintain in the Trump era.\"She speaks their language,\" Susan Meyers, a Republican strategist in Georgia, said in an interview. \"Obviously she's a woman, she's a business owner, and like the president, she's an outsider. She's not another politician.\"But the president himself was not a fan and reportedly told Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Kemp as much in a contentious Oval Office meeting late last year.Taking their cue from Mr. Trump, some of his allies attacked Ms. Loeffler's credentials as insufficiently conservative and fumed when Mr. Kemp appointed her.His allies also criticized her for donating, along with her husband, Jeff, over $1 million to Mr. Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. (Mr. Romney alluded to that support on Monday when asked to respond to her Twitter broadside against him, saying: \"I think a good deal of Senator Loeffler. She and Jeff have supported me time and time again.\")In her inaugural speech after Mr. Kemp announced her appointment, Ms. Loeffler sought to place herself firmly in the right wing of her party.\"I'm a lifelong conservative. Pro-Second Amendment. Pro-military. Pro-wall. And pro-Trump,\" she said. \"I make no apologies for my conservative values, and will proudly support President Trump's conservative judges.\"Supporters say she has taken pains to reach out to grass-roots groups. At a recent political event in Atlanta hosted by the state's Agriculture Department, the Wild Hog Supper, Ms. Loeffler made the rounds and was one of the last people to leave. She posted a photo on Twitter smiling with Penny Nance, the president of Concerned Women of America and a Trump ally, in January and pledged to work with her \"on issues important to Georgia women and families!\"Also buoying Ms. Loeffler's election hopes in November is her own pledge to personally furnish $20 million to her campaign, a staggering number that is sure to make potential challengers think twice before throwing their hat in the ring.But the danger posed by Mr. Collins, who has become one of the president's most strident and public-facing defenders among House Republicans, looms large. He will probably pick up the backing of some of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters who previously cast aspersions on Ms. Loeffler's nomination, like the Fox News host Sean Hannity.Still, Ms. Loeffler has influential allies, including her fellow senator from Georgia, Mr. Perdue, who has emerged as a vocal supporter.\"I think she's going to be fantastic,\" he said. \"She's a student. She looks at these issues very carefully.\"Some of her legislative and campaign homework, however, will most likely be on pause until after the impeachment trial.Cloistered in the Senate chamber for hours a day and commanded to stay silent, she is unable to familiarize herself with the labyrinthine layout of the Capitol or schedule one-on-one meetings to get to know her colleagues or discuss legislation. And under the punishing impeachment schedule, instead of flying home on Friday to meet with voters in Georgia, she will be in her seat on the Senate floor, listening to oral arguments.Supporters say she can handle the challenge.\"Politics is loud and the pressure is on,\" said Ryan Mahoney, a senior strategist close to both Mr. Kemp and Ms. Loeffler. \"But Kelly is tough.\"Nicholas Fandos and Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia has been outspoken in calling herself \"pro-Trump,\" but the president was reportedly not a fan.

Gen. Qassim Suleimani in Baghdad.WASHINGTON -- The United States and Iran exchanged escalating military threats on Friday as President Trump warned that he was \"prepared to take whatever action is necessary\" if Iran threatened Americans and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed to exact vengeance for the killing on Mr. Trump's order of Iran's most valued general.Although the president insisted that he took the action to avoid a war with Iran, the continuing threats further rattled foreign capitals, global markets and Capitol Hill, where Democrats demanded more information about the strike and Mr. Trump's grounds for taking such a provocative move without consulting Congress.Democrats also pressed questions about the attack's timing and whether it was meant to deflect attention from the president's expected impeachment trial this month in the Senate. They said he risked suspicion that he was taking action overseas to distract from his political troubles at home, as in the political movie \"Wag the Dog.\"But Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters in a hastily arranged appearance at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, asserted that Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who directed Iranian paramilitary forces throughout the Middle East, \"was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.\"Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo echoed Mr. Trump's remarks, as did Robert C. O'Brien, the national security adviser. But General Milley, Mr. Pompeo, Mr. O'Brien and other senior administration officials did not describe any threats that were different from what American officials say General Suleimani had been orchestrating for years.Democrats questioned the lack of specifics about any new threat that would justify Mr. Trump's order to kill General Suleimani, which both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had rejected as too risky.\"What always kept both Democratic and Republican presidents from targeting Suleimani himself was the simple question: Was the strike worth the likely retaliation and the potential to pull us into protracted conflict?\" Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan and a former C.I.A. analyst and Pentagon official, said in a statement. \"The two administrations I worked for both determined that the ultimate ends didn't justify the means.\"In Baghdad, the State Department urged American citizens to leave Iraq immediately, citing \"heightened tensions.\" The American Embassy, which had been under siege by pro-Iranian protesters chanting \"Death to America\" in recent days, suspended consular operations.\"U.S. citizens should not approach the Embassy,\" the State Department warned on Twitter. Iraq's Parliament is set to meet on Saturday and could consider a measure to expel all United States forces from the country for the first time since 2003.At Fort Bragg, N.C., some 3,500 members of the 82nd Airborne, ordered to the Middle East this week, prepared to deploy to Kuwait.On Wall Street, the stock market fell as oil prices jumped after the news of the general's death: The price of Brent oil, the international benchmark, surged in the early hours of Hong Kong trading to nearly $70 a barrel -- an increase of $3.The immediate increase in the price of oil was among the largest since an attack on a critical Saudi oil installation in September that temporarily knocked out 5 percent of the world's supply.Mr. Trump said that the killing early Friday of General Suleimani, the commander of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, was long overdue, though he insisted he did not want a larger fight with Iran.\"We took action last night to stop a war,\" the president said. \"We did not take action to start a war.\" But moments later, he warned Iran that the American military had \"already fully identified\" potential targets for further attacks \"if Americans anywhere are threatened.\"By early evening, as he came under growing criticism for what his critics called a reckless national security gamble, Mr. Trump said he wanted to contain the conflict.\"We do not seek war, we do not seek nation-building, we do not seek regime change,\" Mr. Trump told a gathering of his evangelical supporters in Miami, seeming to draw a contrast with the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq.Hours earlier, Ayatollah Khamenei had warned Mr. Trump that there would be consequences for General Suleimani's death, who died after an American MQ-9 Reaper drone fired missiles at his convoy as it was leaving Baghdad International Airport.\"His departure to God does not end his path or his mission,\" Ayatollah Khamenei said in a statement, \"but a forceful revenge awaits the criminals who have his blood and the blood of the other martyrs last night on their hands.\"Writing on Twitter earlier in the day, Mr. Trump suggested that General Suleimani \"got caught\" preparing to hit American targets.\"General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more...but got caught!\" Mr. Trump tweeted, using a different spelling of the general's name. \"He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself.\"An American official said diplomats in Baghdad were nervous about the embassy being the target of retaliation, but noted that Iran had many options, and an embassy attack by pro-Iran militias was only one of them. The embassy is among the most fortified American outposts in the world, and there are other less-guarded targets that Iran could choose.The White House approved the strike on General Suleimani after a rocket attack last Friday on an Iraqi military base outside Kirkuk killed an American civilian contractor and injured other American and Iraqi personnel, according to an American official who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal decision making. The Joint Special Operations Command spent the next several days looking for an opportunity.The option that was eventually approved depended on General Suleimani's arrival on Thursday at the Baghdad airport. If he was met by Iraqi officials, the American official said, the strike would be called off. But the official said it turned out to be a \"clean party,\" and the strike was approved.Briefing reporters on Friday, Mr. O'Brien cited Mr. Trump's \"constitutional authorities as commander in chief to defend our nation\" from attacks like those he said General Suleimani had been plotting. He also cited Congress's 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force. That measure was approved by Congress to grant the administration of President George W. Bush the legal authority to wage war on Saddam Hussein and the government of Iraq.The strike touched off an immediate debate in Washington, with Republicans hailing the action as a decisive blow against a longtime enemy with American blood on his hands and Democrats expressing concern that the president was risking a new war in the Middle East.As a private citizen, Mr. Trump repeatedly accused Mr. Obama of preparing to go to war with Iran to bolster his re-election chances in 2012. As president, Mr. Trump has questioned his own intelligence agencies and peddled repeated falsehoods, a record that could undermine the administration's credibility on the highly delicate subject.Democratic leaders complained that Mr. Trump acted without consulting or even telling Congress first. The president responded by retweeting a post comparing Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, to the Iranians.A post by Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative commentator who was pardoned by Mr. Trump for a campaign finance violation, scoffed at Mr. Schumer's complaint that he was not told in advance. \"Neither were the Iranians, and for pretty much the same reason,\" Mr. D'Souza wrote in the tweet reposted by Mr. Trump.John R. Bolton, the hawkish former national security adviser who left his job in September after clashes with Mr. Trump on Iran and other issues, offered \"congratulations\" on the killing of General Suleimani and said it was a \"decisive blow\" against the Quds Force. Posting on Twitter, he added that he hoped that this was the \"first step to regime change in Tehran.\"Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said that a classified briefing was being arranged for all senators next week and that everyone should welcome the demise of General Suleimani. \"For too long, this evil man operated without constraint, and countless innocents have suffered for it,\" Mr. McConnell said Friday on the Senate floor. \"Now his terrorist leadership has been ended.\"Democrats said Mr. Trump's move could further involve the United States in Middle East conflict rather than pull out as he has promised. \"President Trump came into office saying he wanted to end America's wars in the Middle East, but today we are closer to war with Iran than ever before and the Administration's reckless policy over the last 3 years has brought us to the brink,\" Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland tweeted.General Suleimani, the driving force behind Iranian-sponsored attacks and operations over two decades around the region, including in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, was considered perhaps the second-most powerful figure in Iran, after Ayatollah Khamenei.Mr. Pompeo dismissed concerns raised by American allies, who expressed fear of a wider war in the Middle East. A French minister suggested that \"we are waking up in a more dangerous world\" after the strike.\"Yeah, well, the French are just wrong about that,\" Mr. Pompeo said. \"The world is a much safer place today. And I can assure you Americans in the region are much safer today after the demise of Qassim Suleimani.\"A top Chinese Communist Party official, Yang Jiechi, told Mr. Pompeo in a telephone call that China, Iran's most powerful partner, was \"highly concerned\" about the situation in the Middle East and that \"differences should be resolved through dialogue,\" Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry official, tweeted.Presidents Emmanuel Macron of France and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia spoke by telephone and agreed to try to \"prevent a new and dangerous escalation of tensions,\" according to a summary issued by Mr. Macron's office. The French president also stressed the fight against the Islamic State should be a priority, as well as efforts to get Iran to return to compliance on the 2015 nuclear agreement, from which Mr. Trump withdrew but that Russia, China and three European nations still support.The decision to hit General Suleimani complicates relations with Iraq's government, which has tried to balance itself between the United States and Iran.A senior Iraqi official said Friday that there was a good chance the Iraqi Parliament would vote to force American troops to leave the country. Top Iraqi leaders earlier had wanted to accommodate the troop presence because of the persistent threat from the Islamic State and other regional security matters.On Friday afternoon, the State Department announced it was designating a prominent Iraqi militia supported by Iran as a foreign terrorist organization, in what appeared to be a policy extension of the strike on Mr. Suleimani. The move paved the way for harder American actions against the militia, Aas'ib Ahl al-Haq.The State Department also designated the leaders of the militia, the brothers Qais al-Khazali and Laith al-Khazali, as global terrorists. The group received training and financing from the Quds Force, the elite unit led by Mr. Suleimani, the department said.Dalia Dassa Kaye, an Iran expert at the RAND Corporation, a research organization, said the killing of General Suleimani was a \"major escalation beyond proxy conflict to a direct conflict with Iran that is likely to be viewed in existential terms on Iran's side,\" especially in the wider context of Mr. Trump's continuing sanctions campaign to isolate Iran.She added that likely costs included a rupture with the Iraqi government, which would weaken the fight against the Islamic State; a further alienation of American allies who have been seeking de-escalation this year between Western nations and Iran; and growing challenges to containing Iran's nuclear ambitions.\"Just because the U.S. can take punitive actions doesn't mean it should,\" she said.Michael Crowley, Peter Baker and Edward Wong reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from Palm Beach, Fla.

Three of these contenders -- Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar -- returned after being away for most of the last two weeks at the Senate impeachment trial; no one can say with certainty if their absences will affect their chances in the caucuses.In last-minute rallies, pamphlets and television advertising and even in electric signs placed atop cars that resemble pizza delivery advertisements, the candidates are running more explicitly on their purported viability than in any modern presidential primary.Mr. Sanders, the leading progressive in the field, is increasingly linking his populist platform to an argument that he can peel away disaffected voters from Mr. Trump while a more moderate candidate like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could imperil that effort. Mr. Biden is closing his Iowa campaign with a commercial highlighting his advantage over Mr. Trump in some national and swing-state polls while his leading supporters in Iowa are introducing him to voters by arguing that he could win over their Republican friends.And Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren, who are struggling to match the appeal of their rivals on the party's ideological poles, are infusing their 11th-hour messaging with barely veiled claims that they are safer choices because they won't alienate one flank of the party like Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden.Returning to the Iowa campaign trail on Saturday, Ms. Warren presented herself as the candidate best prepared to rally Democrats for the general election. She addressed a group of volunteers in Urbandale, before a wall of signs reading \"Unite the Party.\" In a Cedar Rapids gymnasium, Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts praised Ms. Warren as \"both empathetic and electable.\"\"We will, we must, come together as a party and beat Donald Trump,\" Ms. Warren said. \"And I've got a plan for that.\"This turn toward I-can-win pragmatism reflects a simple fact of political life in a contest in which at least a third of likely caucusgoers remain undecided just days before the vote. The candidates are responding to the marketplace: Their voters, while deeply split across ideological and generational lines in ways that could still force a showdown at this summer's convention, are united by an all-consuming hunger to unseat Mr. Trump.\"What I'm focused on most is getting that fool out of the White House,\" said Debbie McAllister, who attended a Sioux City rally Friday for Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and is leaning toward him over Ms. Klobuchar.John Norris, who has caucused here every four years since 1976 and is a leading supporter of Ms. Warren, said his fellow Iowa Democrats feel a burden heavier than any he can recall.\"It's Trump,\" said Mr. Norris. \"We saw it a little bit in '04 -- it was we got to stop George W., Iraq war -- but this is that on steroids.\"Even the most bluntly negative campaign tactics have been framed in terms of general-election odds. An outside-spending group, Democratic Majority for Israel, that has dedicated $700,000 to advertising against Mr. Sanders in the last week of the caucus race, has put that whole sum behind a commercial warning that his far-left platform could throw the election to Mr. Trump.\"Democrats believe there is nothing more important than replacing Donald Trump,\" said Mark Mellman, the president of Democratic Majority for Israel and a longtime Democratic pollster. Regarding Mr. Sanders, he added, \"A lot of Democrats don't disagree with him on a lot of positions he has, but we and others are concerned about electability.\"Perhaps most remarkable are the closing appeals of Mr. Sanders of Vermont, whose calls for \"a political revolution\" vaulted him to contention in the 2016 race but who scarcely mentioned his prospects back then against Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz, the two leading Republicans. Mr. Sanders has not diluted his progressive message, but as he stakes out a lead in some Iowa polls the self-proclaimed democratic socialist is turning to hardheaded pragmatism.His campaign ads warn against nominating a candidate without his own unblemished record of opposing cuts to Social Security -- an unmistakable reference to Mr. Biden and his past support for overhauling the program. And at Mr. Sanders's Sioux City field office, his campaign was distributing a pamphlet that read, \"An effective leader with the toughness to defeat Donald Trump.\"Addressing supporters on Saturday in Indianola, Iowa, some of whom wore \"Bernie Beats Trump\" buttons, Mr. Sanders argued that his mammoth volunteer effort in Iowa presaged the sort of organization he could build this fall.\"We are going to knock on 500,000 doors in the month of January and the first two days of February,\" he said, adding: \"That is what we need to do in order to win against Trump.\"Vowing to \"bring millions of people into the political process who normally do not vote,\" Mr. Sanders warned that Democrats will lose \"in a low turnout election.\"Mr. Biden's single-minded focus on electability also stands out, as he goes further than his rivals in attempting to replace political inspiration with cold calculus about cobbling together the 270 Electoral College votes needed to defeat Mr. Trump.\"He beats Trump by the most nationally, and in the states we have to win,\" a narrator says in one of his concluding Iowa television ads.The appeals are no more subtle at his events in Iowa, which often feature former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa and his wife, Christie. At a rally in suburban Des Moines, Ms. Vilsack talked up Mr. Biden's potential appeal among her Republican friends, and Mr. Vilsack rattled off the former vice president's head-to-head advantage in general-election surveys in the traditional swing states.And in an only-in-2020 moment that underscored how the horse race has overtaken policy as a focus right now, Mr. Vilsack drew some of the loudest applause at the entire event by making this observation about polling: \"He's within the margin of error in Texas!\"Two other candidates, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, have used the voter fixation on electability to cast themselves as candidates with the broadest appeal within the party.Mr. Buttigieg organized his campaign schedule in the final weeks of the caucuses around visiting counties that voted for former President Barack Obama before flipping to support Mr. Trump. His aides have circulated statistics about past elections to reporters in each locale, and Mr. Buttigieg has sought to liken himself -- in kind if not by name -- to past general-election winners, like Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama.\"In the last half-century in this country,\" Mr. Buttigieg said at a rally in Marshalltown, Iowa, \"every single time my party has won the White House, without exception, we've done it with a nominee who is looking to the future, moving past the arguments of the past, not a creature of Washington, and opening the door to a new generation.\"In Ankeny, Mr. Buttigieg invoked the impeachment trial -- and Mr. Trump's likely acquittal -- to emphasize the stakes of the election. \"This is our only chance, unless the Senate really surprises us,\" he said, to laughter from the crowd.Ms. Warren has also sought to portray herself as a consensus candidate, airing a commercial that features Iowa supporters of Mr. Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump from 2016 who all say they are now supporting the Massachusetts senator.And in a plain acknowledgment of voters' concerns about sexism in the general election, Ms. Warren released another spot showing a former supporter of Mr. Trump -- an older man from rural Iowa -- directly addressing worries among some voters about nominating a woman. \"For people that say that a woman can't win, I say: nonsense,\" he says, holding up a photograph showing a Trump sign and declaring: \"This is the man to beat, and Elizabeth can do it.\"At a kickoff event for Warren canvassers on Friday morning in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines, Michelle Wu, a Boston city councilor, urged them to reassure anxious voters with a version of that argument, stressing Ms. Warren's victory in 2012 over a popular Republican senator -- the \"barn jacket-wearing, pickup truck-driving Scott Brown\" -- and promising that her economic message would appeal to independents and disaffected Republicans.Not to be outdone on electability is Ms. Klobuchar, who for months has been blunt about why Iowans should turn to her: because she's won every race she's run in an increasingly competitive Midwestern state, Minnesota.While that pitch has made her competitive in Iowa, she has been outspent and has polled below the four leading Democrats.In the campaign's closing days, Ms. Klobuchar, too, is becoming even less subtle: She has printed T-shirts in her signature green reading, \"Amy Klobuchar Will Beat Donald Trump.\"PhotographFor Democratic candidates and voters alike, the overarching factor appears to be boiling down to who is best positioned to defeat President Trump. While former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. goes the furthest in emphasizing electoral calculus over political inspiration, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren are both casting themselves as having the broadest appeal within the party.

But as Michael Bloomberg poured cash into attack ads, he became harder to ignore.For weeks, President Trump's advisers have urged him to ignore Michael R. Bloomberg's nationally televised needling, warning him that it would only help the low-polling late entrant to the Democratic presidential primary by elevating his standing.Mr. Trump heeded the counsel for a while, according to several of his allies, even as he repeatedly expressed anxiety about Mr. Bloomberg's spending. But as he has tuned into coverage of his Senate impeachment trial, Mr. Trump has been pricked by a deluge of television ads funded by the former New York City mayor -- a far wealthier billionaire who has made clear in his public remarks that he doesn't fear the president.The ads have been everywhere, appearing when Mr. Trump catches up on television viewing in Washington and following him to Florida when he visits his new home state. But on Thursday morning, when the spending migrated to Mr. Trump's favorite morning show on Fox News, Mr. Bloomberg's aides all but spoke to the president through the television screen.The show, \"Fox and Friends,\" aired without commentary a new ad from Mr. Bloomberg's team that is based on reporting from a new book, \"A Very Stable Genius,\" describing the language Mr. Trump used to excoriate military generals during a Pentagon meeting in 2017. The ad described him as \"erratic\" and pointed to the \"chaos\" in his administration.Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, appeared on the show to unveil the ad, saying the military is an \"institution that everyone respects. I think people want our commander in chief to respect the institution, and I think he weakens the country by attacking it.\"The ad struck Mr. Trump, with its focus on a topic he has often been concerned about -- maintaining support among members of the military. So the president, who is notorious for reacting to what he sees on Fox News, did just that.\"Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. \"He says that if he loses (he really means when!) in the primaries, he will spend money helping whoever the Democrat nominee is.\"He added: \"By doing this, he figures, they won't hit him as hard during his hopeless 'presidential' campaign. They will remain silent! The fact is, when Mini losses, he will be spending very little of his money on these 'clowns' because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all - and he will be right!\"The president's focus on Mr. Bloomberg is not commensurate with the former mayor's standing in the polls so far. Mr. Bloomberg is still below double digits in nearly every survey after spending more than $256 million on ads in less than two months.Mr. Bloomberg has benefited, however, from being mostly ignored by his primary rivals, some of whom don't want to elevate him in the race, but also don't want to alienate him and his ability to support the Democratic nominee in the general election. And most Democratic strategists remain skeptical that a candidate who once supported aggressive policing policies, who has switched parties three times and who endorsed President George W. Bush in 2004 will be able to win the nomination.From Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to Brad Parscale, his campaign manager, to his polling team and other advisers, the president has been told repeatedly that Mr. Bloomberg isn't worth his attention.Meanwhile, even for some Democratic observers who are uncomfortable with how much money Mr. Bloomberg is flooding into the system, there is a relief in watching the candidate get into Mr. Trump's head in a way that few have.\"Trump fears Bloomberg because Bloomberg is actually the guy who Trump played on TV -- a fantastically wealthy, self-made success with unlimited resources and a willingness to spend it,\" said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama.The Trump campaign played down any worries about Mr. Bloomberg.\"It's a free country and he can set his money on fire if he wants to,\" said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. \"He's still in a statistical tie with the back of the pack in the Democrat field.\"The Trump campaign is dismissive of the idea that Mr. Bloomberg could be an ongoing threat as anything other than the nominee, despite his pledge to spend to support the Democratic standard-bearer through Election Day. And officials have taken note that Mr. Bloomberg's team is trying to mirror the Trump campaign's playbook with online spending.But Mr. Bloomberg's advisers see a void that the candidate is filling, in a primary race during which the candidates have sometimes struggled with whether to depict Mr. Trump as an existential threat or to ignore him altogether. The president, meanwhile, continues to try to set the terms of engagement in the election, threatening to attack them in demeaning, and deeply personal, ways.Howard Wolfson, an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said that Mr. Trump had been \"essentially running unopposed until Mike entered the race.\"\"While the other Democrats are fighting and sniping with one another in Iowa, we are running a nationwide campaign that is taking the fight directly to President Trump on issues where he is extremely vulnerable,\" he said.As for Mr. Trump's nickname for Mr. Bloomberg -- \"Mini\" -- Mr. Wolfson called it \"irrelevant\" and said, \"If you want to think about small, Trump could fit in Mike's pocket. The stature gap, the wealth gap, the success gap, the experience gap, the achievement gap between these two men is vast.\"The Bloomberg campaign has been ratcheting up its attacks as Mr. Trump has reacted to the spending.Guided by extensive internal polling, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign first began directly attacking Mr. Trump with an ad on health care, accusing the president of ruining insurance for millions of Americans and undermining coverage of pre-existing conditions. The ad about pre-existing conditions immediately drew a Twitter rebuke from the president.From health care to the environment to impeachment, the Bloomberg campaign has been running ads attacking Mr. Trump's record nationally, particularly in key swing states. The ad about pre-existing conditions, for example, was backed by more than $1.2 million in the Orlando, Fla., market alone.But, in a further tweak to Mr. Trump, the campaign is also running ads in his strongholds, such as $14 million worth of ads attacking the president in Texas. The state is also a Super Tuesday state, where Mr. Bloomberg hopes to amass delegates.And the Bloomberg campaign confirmed that the ad about the Pentagon that set off Mr. Trump on Thursday morning would continue airing on Fox News.Every television ad attacking Mr. Trump concludes with a contrast to Mr. Bloomberg, whose mayoral record and subsequent activism are portrayed glowingly; none of the ads are simply a takedown of the president.PhotographMichael R. Bloomberg has continued his television ad campaign against President Trump, recently targeting the president's support among members of the military.

Across town, an explosion of anger over Mr. Modi's sectarian policies set a neighborhood on edge, leaving a trail of dead bodies and a widening religious rift.The two sides of New Delhi on display on Tuesday underscored the disparity between the hopes of Mr. Trump's trip and the tensions outside the fortified environs of world leaders. Just miles from the pomp of a presidential visit, a mob of hot-tempered Hindu men wielding iron bars hunted their Muslim neighbors on streets littered with scraps of bricks.As he completed his two-day stay, Mr. Trump focused only on the positive, offering validation of Mr. Modi as a champion of religious liberty even as the Indian government has adopted Hindu-first policies targeting Muslims. The president publicly accepted Mr. Modi's word that he treats the 1.3 billion people in his diverse country fairly without regard to faith and made no mention of the months of protests by those who think otherwise.\"We did talk about religious freedom, and I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"He wants people to have religious freedom, and very strongly.\"\"They have really worked hard on religious freedom,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We talked about it for a long time and I really believe that's what he wants.\"His reluctance to criticize Mr. Modi sharply contrasted with his willingness to assail his domestic critics even while abroad.During his concluding news conference, Mr. Trump attacked Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the former first lady Michelle Obama, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, and the unnamed whistle-blower whose disclosures led to the president's impeachment.He also confirmed that his White House had embarked on a hunt for disloyal officials to purge in the aftermath of his acquittal in a Senate trial but said it would not be \"very many people,\" without estimating how many. \"We want to have people that are good for the country, are loyal to our country,\" he said. \"Because that was a disgraceful situation.\"The president's embrace of Mr. Modi came at a time when the government has revoked the statehood of Kashmir, the disputed majority Muslim territory; rounded up Muslim leaders there; and enacted a law giving preference to non-Muslim migrants naturalizing as citizens. Protests over the citizenship law culminated in street violence that cost at least 11 lives since Sunday.Mr. Trump made no public mention of those actions until asked and even then professed no view of them. Instead, he framed his first visit to India as president on terms he preferred.Just as religious disputes drew no outward concern, the president insisted that the two leaders had made \"tremendous progress\" toward the landmark trade agreement he has sought even though there was no evident sign of breakthrough on the major issues that have divided negotiators for months.\"We think we're at a point where our relationship is so special with India, it has never been as good as it is now,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We feel very strongly about each other, and we have done something that is very unique.\"The president often personalizes his relations with foreign leaders. His willingness to accept Mr. Modi's version of events recalled Mr. Trump's deference to President Vladimir V. Putin's denials that Russia had intervened in the 2016 presidential election and his professed belief in Kim Jong-un's vague promises to give up North Korea's nuclear weapons.Even Mr. Trump's boasts about the scale of his reception in India were extravagant.He claimed before his arrival that Mr. Modi had promised him crowds of up to 10 million people. The actual number lining the streets of Ahmedabad on Monday was well under one-tenth that amount. Despite saying he had been told his greeting was the greatest \"ever given to any head of state from any country,\" Mr. Trump was not even the top-drawing American president to visit India looking back to Dwight D. Eisenhower's crowds.Only after he was no longer in Mr. Modi's presence did Mr. Trump return to some of his longstanding complaints about India's trade policies, complaining to reporters that New Delhi maintained unfairly high tariffs on American goods, including Harley Davidson motorcycles.But while the two leaders were together, it was all sunshine, long on florid language about the strength of their relationship and short on concrete results. Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi celebrated a series of modest agreements that were set before the visit, including a $3 billion arms purchase and a letter of cooperation between Exxon Mobil and India's energy sector. They agreed to create a joint counternarcotics working group to reduce opioid abuse.During his news conference, Mr. Trump also addressed growing alarm over the coronavirus and the return of 14 Americans infected with coronavirus to the country last week. He defended that action, even though he was privately furious about it.\"I felt that we should bring them back,\" he said. \"They're Americans -- we should bring them back.\"During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Africa, Mr. Trump tweeted in outrage that Americans infected with that virus should not be allowed into the country. Asked whether his current view clashed with his prior one, he rejected the comparison.\"There's a vast difference\" between the two epidemics, Mr. Trump said, noting that Ebola was nearly always fatal while the death rate among those infected with the new coronavirus has been relatively low. \"At that time, nobody had ever even heard of Ebola or ever conceived of something where you basically -- the people would disintegrate.\" (Ebola was widely known by 2014.)Mr. Trump also vowed not to accept foreign assistance during his re-election campaign and rejected American intelligence assessments that Russia was already working to help him as it did in 2016.\"I want no help from any country, and I haven't been given help from any country,\" Mr. Trump said.Mr. Modi welcomed Mr. Trump to the presidential palace on Tuesday with the roar of guns and an honor guard of red-uniformed soldiers on horseback and later hosted him at a lavish state banquet. \"President Trump's contribution in raising our relations to this level have been invaluable,\" Mr. Modi said.Mr. Trump basked in the visit. \"Nobody else that came here got the kind of reception we got,\" Mr. Trump said.The two leaders declined to answer questions at their joint appearance before the news media. Although Mr. Modi has taken questions from reporters while overseas next to other world leaders, he is the first prime minister in recent memory to not have held any news conferences in India. And so Mr. Trump waited until later to meet reporters on his own.He did gently urge Mr. Modi's government to respect freedom on the internet, which the Indian government has shut down repeatedly. Talking about the need for secure 5G wireless, the president added that it should be \"a tool for freedom, progress, prosperity -- not to do anything where it could be even conceived as a conduit for suppression and censorship.\"A trade deal with India has been a priority for two years for Mr. Trump, who would like another economic agreement to show while campaigning before the November election. But the two sides have been divided over farm products, medical devices, digital trade and new tariffs. Mr. Trump has complained that India treats the United States unfairly and called Mr. Modi a \"tough negotiator.\"\"Our teams have made tremendous progress on a comprehensive trade agreement, and I'm optimistic we can reach a deal that will be of great importance to both countries,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, without elaborating.For Mr. Trump, it was a day to emphasize the optimism. It was, he said, \"a very special visit -- unforgettable, extraordinary.\"PhotographPresident Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, at Raj Ghat, a Gandhi memorial, in New Delhi on Tuesday.

Bolton might testify, Mr. Trump had a chance to stand in the East Room and cast himself as a peacemaker. With rare self-discipline, he never mentioned the word impeachment.For his part, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel marches toward his March elections wielding the potent argument that Israelis should ignore his indictment on corruption charges and focus on the fact that he, by force of his relationship with Mr. Trump, moved Washington to give permanent legitimacy to the Jewish settlements in disputed territory.By Sunday, the prime minister said as he was leaving Washington, Israel will essentially annex the strategically vital part of the Jordan Valley that its military already controls. As the Israeli election nears, those moves allow him to sell himself as the Trump whisperer, the indispensable man who bent the White House to his will.\"Strip away the domestic and Israeli political considerations that determined the timing of the plan's release,\" said Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group and a former Obama administration official, \"and the message to the Palestinians, boiled down to its essence, is: You've lost, get over it.\"That message, implicitly or explicitly, rewrites the art of the Middle East deal. By tilting the map of a future Palestinian state so precipitously in Israel's direction, Mr. Trump has embraced a plan that essentially dismantles 60 years of bipartisan support for a negotiated process between Israelis and Palestinians, in which both make concessions and land swaps that would define the lines of a new map.As Mr. Trump acknowledged, Washington would no longer play the role of neutral arbiter -- even while vowing to be Israel's source of protection. Instead, the United States has drawn the lines in a series of maps that sketch out a future Palestinian state that is so gerrymandered that it requires the construction of a giant tunnel across Israel to connect two areas of Palestinian control.To Mr. Trump, this is the merger of deal making, Middle East urban planning and election-year politics -- or rather, potential deal making.A few days ago Mr. Trump said, \"I think we're relatively close but we have to get other people to agree to it.\" In other words the \"deal of the century\" was no deal at all. And the other people were the Palestinians, who dismissed the proposal and the accompanying map on Tuesday hours after its publication.For election purposes, Mr. Trump does not need a deal, he simply needs the impression that progress is being made.And at the White House on Tuesday, the ambassadors from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman -- but not Saudi Arabia, the country Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has worked hardest to woo -- were in the room for the announcement, a seeming endorsement of his approach, if not the specifics.Their presence would have been unimaginable in the past, especially for any announcement that fell well short of creating a real Palestinian state.And this one certainly falls short of that goal. Mr. Trump's 180-page plan would require the Palestinians to accept only partial sovereignty over a future Palestinian state, at least for a considerable time, and give up any claim to territory where the Israelis have already accepted settlements. And it asked them to take the bet that, as Mr. Trump promised, they would ultimately get rich because of a $50 billion investment fund, paid for by Arab neighbors.It has a brilliant twist: The Palestinians do not have to say yes or no for four years. That means their bottom-line response would not come until the very end of Mr. Trump's next term, if he is re-elected. In the meantime, Israel would freeze settlements in the territory that Mr. Trump has set aside for the Palestinians, much of it areas the Israelis have little interest in.That proviso defers all the hard questions for several years of negotiations -- with their inevitable breakdowns and crises. But it gives Mr. Trump the campaign-trail talking point that he has fulfilled a 2016 promise and proposed an actual solution, rather than just a process.The proposal, of course, helps Mr. Netanyahu by moving the goal posts. The status of Jerusalem is set out in the Trump document, rather than being a subject of negotiation. And while past presidents lectured Mr. Netanyahu about his creation of Jewish settlements in territories that are subject to negotiation, Mr. Trump's plan makes them a permanent feature.To critics, that is the fatal flaw.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who was among the lawmakers briefed by Mr. Kushner at the White House, called it \"a total abandonment of decades of U.S. Middle East policy.\"He was referring to the longtime American support for a deal that would include only modest adjustments to the Israeli borders drawn in 1967, the year of the Arab-Israeli War, and by a process created in the Oslo Accords, which began in 1993 and largely ended with the failed summit in 2000 at Camp David. The premise of those talks was that the Israelis and Palestinians would set up a complex process and inch their way toward agreements on borders, settlements, political rights and the withdrawal of the Israeli military from Palestinian lands.There were years of talks, stalemates, \"road maps to peace,\" collapsed negotiations and intifadas.Mr. Trump, the disrupter, has made it clear he does not believe that approach would work. On Tuesday, he noted that every president since Lyndon B. Johnson had tried and failed to negotiate a peace deal. Always the real-estate mogul, Mr. Trump has declared that he is more interested in working with existing facts on the ground than on creating processes.So his plan, three years in the making, is less about future negotiations and more about cementing what exists today and making deals around the edges. If the Palestinians take it, he suggested, riches would follow. There would be a million new jobs, he said, and poverty would be cut in half. Mr. Trump has offered a similar incentive to the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un.It was pretty familiar Trump language, born of a certainty that economic incentives will overcome ethnic, tribal and religious differences, despite considerable evidence to the contrary. And for the Israeli prime minister, it was a plan tailor-made for an election four weeks away. So tailor-made that a dozen Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump on Tuesday that \"the timing of this proposal to coincide with Prime Minister Netanyahu's indictment on bribery charges also raises disturbing questions about your intention to intervene in the Israeli election process.\"Not surprisingly, Mr. Netanyahu disagreed. \"It's a great plan for Israel,\" he said, with an enthusiasm he rarely showed during visits to the White House in the Obama years. \"It's a great plan for peace.\"PhotographPresident Trump with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at the White House on Tuesday.

He has repeatedly said he does not know them.WASHINGTON -- For more than an hour one evening in 2018, President Trump sat around a dinner table in a private suite in his Washington hotel with a group of donors, including two men at the center of the impeachment inquiry, talking about golf, trade, politics -- and removing the United States ambassador to Ukraine.The conversation, captured on a recording made public Saturday, contradicted Mr. Trump's repeated statements that he does not know the two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who went on to work with the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to carry out a pressure campaign on Ukraine.The recording -- a video shot on Mr. Fruman's phone during the dinner in April 2018 -- largely confirmed Mr. Parnas's account of having raised with Mr. Trump criticisms of the ambassador to Kyiv at the time, Marie L. Yovanovitch, and the president's immediate order that Ms. Yovanovitch should be removed from the post.\"Get rid of her,\" Mr. Trump can be heard responding.The recording was made public by Mr. Parnas's lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, hours after the president's lawyers began presenting their defense in the impeachment trial and as Democrats looked for leverage to persuade Republicans to support their calls to expand the inquiry by introducing additional evidence and calling new witnesses.Mr. Bondy said it was being released in \"an effort to provide clarity to the American people and the Senate as to the need to conduct a fair trial, with witnesses and evidence.\"In the recording, Mr. Parnas, who is the more talkative of the two, broached an energy deal the two were pursuing in Ukraine, and then went on to discuss several themes that later became central to the pressure campaign. He claimed that Ms. Yovanovitch, whose name he did not cite, had been disparaging Mr. Trump. He said that the Ukrainians \"were supporting the Clintons all these years.\" He even mentioned in passing the family of the former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.The recording does not appear to introduce substantive new information about the effort to oust Ms. Yovanovitch.But it does seem to shed light on the origins of Mr. Trump's interest in the issue, and to foreshadow his administration's withholding of military assistance from the country as part of the pressure campaign. It hints at the motivations of Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who had come to believe that Ms. Yovanovitch was opposed to their business plans in Ukraine, where they had tried to break into the natural gas market, according to associates of the two men, both of whom are Soviet-born American citizens.And it provides a glimpse of something rarely seen: top-tier political donors getting a chance in an intimate setting to share their views with the president and press their agendas with him.During the dinner, Mr. Trump lashed out at the European Union for trying to \"screw\" the United States, assailed the World Trade Organization as a \"weapon\" intended to harm America and lamented the \"globalists\" around him who do not care if manufacturing plants shutter.Democrats are seeking Mr. Trump's removal from office on the grounds that he abused his power by pressing Ukraine to investigate targets of the president, including Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman worked closely with Mr. Giuliani in seeking information and making contacts in Ukraine in support of the effort, starting months after the April 2018 dinner.For most of the recording, the camera is pointed at the ceiling but the audio is clear. Early in the recording, Mr. Trump can be seen as he enters the private room at the Trump International Hotel in Washington on April 30, 2018.The existence and some of the conversation in the recording were first reported by ABC News on Friday.The effort to oust Ms. Yovanovitch would later become directly linked to the broader pressure campaign on Ukraine waged by Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. Evidence provided to House investigators showed that Mr. Parnas was in regular contact last year with Ukraine's chief prosecutor, who also wanted Ms. Yovanovitch replaced, and seemed to be willing to trade investigations of Mr. Biden for her removal and other signs of support from the Trump administration.By the time of the dinner with Mr. Trump, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman already saw Ms. Yovanovitch as an impediment to their efforts to get into the energy business in Ukraine.In the full recording released on Saturday, Mr. Parnas can be heard telling Mr. Trump that he and Mr. Fruman \"are in the process of purchasing an energy company in Ukraine right now.\"Mr. Trump responds, \"How's Ukraine doing?\" then quickly adds, \"Don't answer,\" prompting laughter in the room.After some conversation about Ukraine's war with its hostile neighbor, Russia, and its efforts to establish energy security, Mr. Trump asked, \"How long would they last in a fight with Russia?\"\"I don't think very long,\" Mr. Parnas responded. \"Without us, not very long,\" adding \"they feel they're going to be O.K. if you support them.\"Mr. Parnas continued by saying that \"the biggest problem is corruption there,\" and later added Ms. Yovanovitch, though not by name, to a list of issues Mr. Trump should address in Ukraine.\"The biggest problem there, I think, where we, where you, need to start is we got to get rid of the ambassador,\" he said. \"She's basically walking around telling everybody, 'Wait, he's going to get impeached, just wait.\"'The remark prompted laughter in the room.Mr. Trump asked for the ambassador's name. Mr. Fruman said, \"I don't remember.\" Mr. Trump, sounding stern, then said: \"Get rid of her. Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. O.K.? Do it.\"Those comments were directed at one of Mr. Trump's aides who was in the room at the time, Mr. Parnas has previously said. There was some additional laughter in the room at Mr. Trump's remarks.Ms. Yovanovitch remained in her job for another year after Mr. Trump's remarks until she was recalled on the White House's orders. It is not clear whether the president changed his mind, forgot about his order or was talked out of dismissing her. Mr. Parnas has recently acknowledged that he was wrong about Ms. Yovanovitch, who has denied ever disparaging Mr. Trump.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has previously acknowledged that he had problems with Ms. Yovanovitch but has defended his actions as appropriate, given that presidents have the right to name and replace ambassadors as they see fit.Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman gained access to the dinner, which was organized by a pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, by pledging to donate $1 million to the group.The month after the event, they donated $325,000 to the group through a company they had recently formed to pursue energy deals called Global Energy Producers.At the beginning of the video, the person holding the phone walks around the private suite filming chatter among the guests, who included Donald Trump Jr., Jack Nicklaus III, the grandson and namesake of the legendary golfer, and Barry Zekelman, a Canadian billionaire whose steel business is mostly in the United States.Later, Mr. Trump said to attendees, \"This is all sort of, like, off the record, right?\"During the dinner, attendees fawned over Mr. Trump and seemed to revel in their ability to ask him for direct help with business issues.In the meandering conversation, Mr. Trump defended the aggressive actions he was taking against China and explained that he overruled advisers who urged him to take a softer approach because the United States was already so deeply on the losing end of the relationship.\"They're tough, but I always say when you're $500 billion down, you can't lose the trade war,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to the bilateral trade deficit the United States runs with China.Mr. Trump, who has since reached a trade truce with China, foreshadowed his next big trade fight, taking aim at the European Union.\"The European Union is a group of countries that got together to screw the United States, it's as simple as that,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that such a notion is surprising because \"we're all sort of from there, right?\"The conversation came just one month after Mr. Trump had slapped tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, including metals imported from Europe.At the dinner, Mr. Trump repeatedly praised the tariffs, though he occasionally expressed concern that they could reduce the amount of available metals. \"I don't want to be at a point where we don't have enough steel in this country,\" he said. A few minutes later, he added, \"You're going to see prices go up. Hopefully not too much.\"It has been a decade since legal changes paved the way for unlimited donations to super PACs, making such gatherings an even more explicit demonstration of how a large political payment can turn into access to push a special interest.The donors competed for time to walk through their sometimes conflicting issues, one by one, pitching the president to take up their causes almost as if they were on \"Shark Tank,\" the reality television show, looking for investors in their ideas.Mr. Zekelman, a Canadian citizen who owns a steel tube manufacturing company that donated $1.75 million to the political action committee supporting Mr. Trump, pushed the president on what he saw as the top two challenges facing his company: cheap steel tube imports from Asia and new federal rules that make it harder to find truck drivers.He first urged Mr. Trump to go even further in his effort to limit steel imports to the United States, and he then questioned the rules intended to prevent fatal truck accidents by using electronic monitoring systems to limit how many hours drivers can be on the road.Since that dinner, legislation has been introduced in the House with the co-sponsorship of 12 Republicans, including the brother of Vice President Mike Pence, to allow smaller trucking companies to get exemptions from the rule.Mr. Zekelman is not legally allowed under federal law to make a contribution to the political action committee. So his company donated the money through one of its subsidiaries based in the United States, a maneuver that has generated a complaint with the Federal Election Commission that he might have violated federal election law, after The New York Times wrote about the donations last year.One attendee told Mr. Trump that he operates a company that supplies trucks powered by compressed natural gas and urged Mr. Trump to take steps to make the business more competitive with electric powered trucks or cars.Another, who said he runs a company that does business with the United States Postal Service, pushed Mr. Trump to consider backing the construction of a 500-mile section of highway in the United States that would be used exclusively by self-driving trucks. Paying truck drivers, he said, is one of his company's biggest costs.\"All the technology is there, right now,\" he said. \"It is absolutely safe.\"Mr. Parnas did not limit his efforts to influence Mr. Trump to Ukraine. He can be heard trying to engage Mr. Trump about issues related to another business venture he would go on to pursue -- a plan to win marijuana retail licenses in Nevada and elsewhere.He appeared to ask Mr. Trump to consider changing regulations that banks have said made it difficult for them to process transactions related to the cannabis business.\"Have you thought about allowing banking in some of these states that allow cannabis?\" Mr. Parnas asked.\"What?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"You can't do banking there?\"Mr. Parnas said banking regulations were \"the biggest problem\" for the industry, and argued that the issue could help Mr. Trump politically. If the president created a bipartisan committee to study it, Mr. Parnas argued \"you can know what's going on, and make the right decision. By just putting the committee together, it will give you such a boost in the midterm with a lot of the millennials.\"Mr. Trump expressed some skepticism, saying marijuana use has led to \"more accidents\" and asserting \"it does cause an I.Q. problem.\"But Donald Trump Jr. seemed more agreeable, arguing \"between that and alcohol, as far as I'm concerned alcohol does much more damage,\" and asserting \"you don't see people beating their wives on marijuana. It's just different.\"A spokesman for the younger Mr. Trump did not respond to a request for comment.In the months after the dinner, Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and two associates tried to enlist political support for an effort to win marijuana retail licenses in Nevada and elsewhere by planning to spend $1 million to $2 million for potential political donations, some of which prosecutors say was funded by a Russian investor, according to an indictment against the men.They have pleaded not guilty.Kenneth P.

Bush, who ran for president before legal changes allowed joint committees to accept six-figure checks, were prodigious fund-raisers who tended to their bundling networks, ranking them based on the amount they had raised and rewarding the bundlers with names like \"Pioneers\" and \"Ramblers\" and giving them special access at retreats and other events.\"In this environment, you should have a program for every segment of the giving community,\" said Scott Reed, the campaign manager for Senator Bob Dole's presidential race in 1996.Mr. Trump has never appreciated the need for that kind of fund-raising, in part because of his disdain for the type of attention that donors expect in return, advisers have said.The president's fund-raising has also benefited from the legal changes in 2014 that allow his political operation to collect six-figure checks by joint committees with the Republican Party -- options not available to Republican candidates before Mr. Trump.But the move to focus more on bundlers comes as Mr. Trump has been increasingly concerned by how much his potential Democratic opponents are spending, particularly Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor who estimates he has spent several hundred million dollars so far on his campaign and is prepared to spend as much as a billion dollars in all.Mr. Trump's team has named Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Fox News personality and girlfriend of the president's oldest son who has also become a top campaign surrogate, as the national chairwoman for the Trump Victory Finance Committee.Among her roles will be overseeing the bundler program, which started in May and is set to get more structure, as the campaign heads toward the general election in the fall.Ms. Guilfoyle said in an interview that there were already new donors who have approached her at events she has done around the country for Mr. Trump who were looking for a point of contact for their giving.\"I want to give them the confidence that their money is going to be put to excellent use,\" she said, noting that for many people, \"this is the first time that they've written a check to a politician.\"Ms. Guilfoyle, the former wife of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, has an extensive Rolodex in that state and in New York, where donors to previous Republican candidates have been generally cool to Mr. Trump, particularly donors who supported Mr. Romney, the party's presidential nominee in 2012.But she said she was also looking to develop new bundlers who could keep building on the campaign's network.\"Kimberly uniquely unites all elements of the Trump coalition, and it is a reflection of the importance the Trump family places on the fund-raising program,\" said Jack Oliver, a bundler for Mr. Bush.For the past year, the question of how much the president might need such \"hard dollar\" checks has been a source of debate and, at times, contention among his aides. But there has been little effort to cultivate people who can gather checks in increments of $2,800 at a rapid clip, according to multiple campaign advisers.Last spring, allies of the president urged Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser who is directing Mr. Trump's campaign from the White House, to do more to cultivate bundlers.But it became an issue in the rivalry between Mr. Kushner and Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.More recently, the two have reached a détente, according to people close to the campaign. Still, the fund-raising concerns remain, and Mr. Kushner has said he wished some of the top fund-raisers who were rewarded by the president with ambassadorships were still able to raise money, according to two people familiar with his statements.Mr. Trump's campaign has repeatedly highlighted its fund-raising numbers, referring to them as \"staggering\" in a recent news release. The president began the year with close to $200 million in cash on hand between his campaign, the Republican National Committee and other affiliated entities. The groups raised just over a collective $460 million in 2019.This past week, thanks to joint fund-raising agreements between the campaign, the national committee and 22 state parties, the Trump political operation increased the maximum contribution it could accept to $580,600 per person, giving wealthy donors the ability to park more of their money with the Trump re-election effort.But some of the money that goes to the committee is restricted to specific uses, while the hard-dollar money can be used for broader purposes, like staff, advertising and field operations.PhotographSupporters of President Trump this month at a \"Keep America Great\" rally in Toledo, Ohio.

A group of Trump loyalists from the House -- including Representatives Elise Stefanik of New York, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Matt Gaetz of Florida -- will also be on the ground to make their case for Mr. Trump, the campaign announced Tuesday.They will be joined by a host of loyal \"formers,\" including Mr. Trump's former 2016 campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski; the former White House communications director, Bill Shine; and Matthew Whitaker, an Iowa native who briefly served as the acting attorney general.\"Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come,\" said Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's 2020 campaign manager. \"This will be the strongest, best funded and most organized presidential campaign in history. We are putting the Democrats on notice: good luck trying to keep up with this formidable re-election machine.\"The idea is to show off a deep well of support for Mr. Trump even as Democrats are choosing their nominee in a nail-biter of a contest that will help whoever emerges as the winner and determine the shape of the rest of the party's primary fight.Senator Bernie Sanders, the crowd-drawing independent from Vermont, has placed first in Iowa in a series of polls, and Mr. Trump has recently been seeking to elevate his candidacy. Mr. Trump has also been focused on Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, who is running a parallel effort in the states that will vote on Super Tuesday on March 3 and skip Iowa altogether.Incumbents -- and party nominees -- often try to swamp early states where their opponents are campaigning by flying in government officials who volunteer their personal time for the campaign, along with lawmakers and aides. But Mr. Trump's show of force is still unusual.\"I'm even pleasantly taken aback by this over-the-top interest in Iowa,\" said Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. \"This is about making a statement on the part of the president.\"Mr. Trump placed second in Iowa in 2016, after Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. This time around, two Republican challengers, Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, have failed to make any dent in Mr. Trump's support from Republican voters.But the Trump campaign said their showing in Iowa was less about two opponents it has been studiously ignoring and more about recruiting volunteers and small-dollar donors, with whom they will continue to engage through November.\"Strategically, it's important for Trump surrogates to be in Iowa to consume some of the media coverage,\" said David Bossie, who was Mr. Trump's deputy campaign manager in 2016 and plans to participate in the Iowa offensive. \"We want to plant the flag, because we are looking ahead to the general election.\"Mr. Bossie said it would be a mistake to ignore a battleground state simply because there was no competitive primary on the Republican side.\"I don't think anybody on that plane is worried about Bill Weld,\" added Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. \"This campaign is always on offense; it's on its front foot. It doesn't give Democrats a day to do their own thing.\"Mr. Trump himself is expected in Des Moines for a rally on Thursday night, a move Mr. Kaufmann compared to President Ronald Reagan showing up in Iowa during his re-election campaign in 1984.\"Back then, he had no competition in the caucus, but he made it a statement that he's not taking Iowa for granted,\" Mr. Kaufmann said. \"For all practical purposes, this is the beginning of the general election.\"PhotographHousing Secretary Ben Carson is one of the former presidential candidates who will travel to Iowa to support President Trump.

Barr's pleas to stop publicly intervening in prosecutions where he had a personal interest.Speaking out hours after his friend Roger J. Stone Jr. was sentenced to more than three years in prison for lying to protect the president, Mr. Trump belittled the case and hinted broadly that he would use his clemency power to spare Mr. Stone if a judge did not agree to a retrial sought by defense lawyers.In essentially dangling a pardon or a commutation for a friend, Mr. Trump confronted Mr. Barr with a choice about how to respond after he declared last week that the president's attacks on the criminal justice system were making his job \"impossible.\"\"A lot of bad things are happening, and we're cleaning it out,\" Mr. Trump said of law enforcement at a Las Vegas event for former convicts re-entering society. \"We're cleaning the swamp. We're draining the swamp. I just never knew how deep the swamp was.\"He added: \"We had a lot of dirty cops. F.B.I. is phenomenal. I love the people in the F.B.I. But the people at the top were dirty cops.\"Mr. Barr last week reversed the Justice Department's original request, in line with federal guidelines, for a term of seven to nine years for Mr. Stone, leading four career prosecutors to quit the case and one to resign from the department altogether.But even as he agreed with Mr. Trump that the sentencing recommendation was excessive, he went on ABC News to publicly ask the president to stop commenting because \"I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\"Mr. Trump later agreed that he was making Mr. Barr's job harder but indicated he would not stay quiet.While Mr. Trump again erupted on Thursday, some in Mr. Barr's camp took solace in the fact that the president did not directly attack the judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson, the prosecutors or the sentence itself and that he said he admired the F.B.I. rank and file, even though he continued to target its current and former leadership.Mr. Barr has come to recognize that he may never be able to keep Mr. Trump quiet altogether and so in parsing the president's latest comments, the attorney general and his team chose to see them as progress and an opportunity to work out their differences without further public exchange.Mr. Barr, who has suggested to associates that he may have to resign if the president keeps tweeting about individual prosecutions, stayed silent after Mr. Trump's remarks, and the department declined to comment.Over the last week, some of Mr. Trump's closest Republican allies in Congress, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and some of the president's favorite Fox News commentators have been trying to smooth over the rift by vouching for Mr. Barr and urging the president to let the legal process play out, according to people familiar with the matter.After the judge sentenced Mr. Stone on Thursday, Mr. Graham noted on Twitter that the term was \"on the lower end\" and emphasized that a president could always grant clemency. He urged that there be no undue interference in legal cases -- without quite saying whom he was addressing.\"It is important to give both the government and the accused a fair trial free from influence,\" Mr. Graham wrote. \"I believe this has been accomplished in Mr. Stone's case. Like all Americans, Mr. Stone can appeal the fairness of his trial and the verdict rendered. Under our system of justice President Trump has all the legal authority in the world to review this case, in terms of commuting the sentence or pardoning Mr. Stone for the underlying offense.\"Mr. Trump's critics maintained that extending clemency to Mr. Stone would amount to self-dealing for a president who stood to benefit from the convicted adviser's lies about connections to WikiLeaks, which disseminated Democratic emails stolen by Russian agents to damage Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign.\"Roger Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress and threatening a witness,\" said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, the panel that Mr. Stone was convicted of obstructing. \"He did it to cover up for Trump. His sentence is justified. It should go without saying, but to pardon Stone when his crimes were committed to protect Trump would be a breathtaking act of corruption.\"In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Trump dismissed the significance of Mr. Stone's crimes. He complained that the Justice Department prosecuted his friend for lying and obstructing a congressional inquiry, but did not charge his enemies like Mrs. Clinton, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, Mr. Comey's onetime deputy Andrew G. McCabe or the former F.B.I. officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.\"What happened to him is unbelievable,\" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Stone. \"They say he lied. But other people lied, too. Just to mention, Comey lied. McCabe lied. Lisa Page lied. Her lover, Strzok, Peter Strzok, lied. You don't know who these people are? Just trust me, they all lied.\"He went on to revive the email case involving Mrs. Clinton. \"Hillary Clinton leaked more classified documents than any human being, I believe, in the history of the United States,\" he said. But, he added, \"nothing happened to her.\"In repeating his attacks on his favorite targets, Mr. Trump distorted or misstated the facts. Mrs. Clinton was not accused of leaking classified documents, much less the most in history. She was investigated for using a private computer server that was not as secure as a government server to send emails, some of which were later found to include classified information.Mr. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, faulted her for carelessness but said \"no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\" His surprise announcement that he was briefly reopening the investigation days before the 2016 election has been blamed by many Democrats for contributing to Mrs. Clinton's defeat.By contrast, Mr. Trump mocked the case against Mr. Stone, including the witness intimidation charge. \"It's not like the tampering that I see on television when you watch a movie,\" the president said. \"That's called tampering -- with guns to people's heads and lots of other things.\"He repeated his assertion that the jury forewoman in Mr. Stone's case was \"totally tainted\" and an \"anti-Trump activist,\" which he said should compel the judge to order a new trial. The Justice Department opposes a new trial, a position approved by Mr. Barr.Mr. Trump left the strong impression, however, that he would use his clemency power if the judge did not go along with the defense motion, saying that he would \"love to see Roger exonerated.\"\"I'm going to watch the process. I'm going to watch it very closely,\" Mr. Trump added. \"And at some point, I'll make a determination. But Roger Stone and everybody has to be treated fairly, and this has not been a fair process. OK?\"Charlie Savage and Katie Benner contributed reporting.PhotographAttorney General William P.

Mr. Tuberville received the most votes, and polls show him with a comfortable lead heading into the runoff against Mr. Sessions, which is scheduled for March 31.\"Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. \"He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down! Tommy will protect your Second Amendment (which is under siege), is strong on Crime and the Border, and truly LOVES our Military and our Vets. He will be a great Senator for the people of Alabama. Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love Alabama!\"The endorsement had been a possibility since the end of the primary, during which Mr. Trump had agreed to requests from some Republicans to stay on the sidelines. His reward was being able to criticize Mr. Sessions once it was over -- something he did the day after the primary took place.Mr. Sessions, who formerly held a Senate seat in Alabama, had left that post to join the Trump administration as the president's first attorney general. But Mr. Trump never forgave Mr. Sessions, a campaign surrogate in 2016, for recusing himself from the investigation into whether there was a conspiracy between Russian officials and the Trump campaign.After publicly humiliating Mr. Sessions for 18 months, Mr. Trump fired him in late 2018.Mr. Tuberville has had his own bar to clear: He said in a campaign appearance in August 2019 that he was \"pissed off\" at Mr. Trump over health care for veterans, a video of which has circulated in recent weeks and which Mr. Sessions used in a campaign ad. Since then, Mr. Tuberville has praised Mr. Trump and equated him to a head coach getting insufficient information from assistants.In a primary campaign ad when he entered the race, Mr. Sessions lavished praise on Mr. Trump and highlighted that he had endorsed the president early in his 2016 presidential campaign.The runoff winner will face the incumbent, Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat, in November. Mr. Jones is seen as one of the most, if not the most, vulnerable Democrats in the Senate, and the race is being closely watched as the party tries to reclaim the majority from the Republicans.PhotographTommy Tuberville will face Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, in a run-off election for Senate in Alabama this month.

But the path forward remains murky, with few historical precedents and scant constitutional guidance to light the way. While decades-old congressional rules will be dusted off in the coming days, other, potentially grave decisions that could color the outcome of the trial will be settled on the fly.Here is how we expect things to play out on Capitol Hill in the coming days and weeks.First up: naming managers and a vote to press charges.The House passed two articles of impeachment nearly along party lines on Dec. 18, after a monthslong Democratic inquiry. The articles charged Mr. Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in connection with a scheme to enlist a foreign power for help in the 2020 election. They accused him of using his presidency to pressure Ukraine to investigate his Democratic political rivals, by withholding a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in military aid as leverage.Now, to move forward after nearly a month of delay, the House has to vote to approve a team of a half-dozen or so lawmakers to serve as prosecutors, or managers, and formally press charges in the Senate. A vote is expected Tuesday or Wednesday.Speaker Nancy Pelosi will most likely unveil her roster of managers before the vote, but she is still trying to assemble a diverse group of lawmakers suited to the task. One thing is clear: The team will almost certainly be led by Representatives Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.'Hear ye, hear ye': The opening of the Senate's trial is largely scripted by precedent and rules.The House vote will initiate a carefully choreographed dance, filled with pomp, circumstance and arcane procedural flourishes, between the House and Senate.It begins with each chamber sending up a flare of sorts. The House first notifies the Senate it has appointed managers. The Senate responds that it is ready to receive them and exhibit the articles of impeachment.After that, the House managers will march from their chamber across the Capitol, through the elaborately painted Rotunda under the dome, to the Senate chamber, to deliver a bound copy of the impeachment articles to senators assembled for the occasion.Once the managers arrive, the Senate sergeant-at-arms will cry out \"Hear ye! Hear ye!\" and give senators a warning to stay quiet:All persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against Donald John Trump, president of the United States.One of the managers will then read aloud and in full the House's two articles from the well of the Senate, before the whole team leaves.Swearing of oaths: The chief justice arrives on the scene.Next, senators will escort Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. into the Senate chamber. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the president pro tem of the Senate -- the longest-serving Republican -- will administer an oath to Chief Justice Roberts, who will swear to administer \"impartial justice.\" Then Chief Justice Roberts will ask senators to raise their right hands and agree to the same oath:I solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me God.Each senator then must step up, one by one, to sign his or her name in a book attesting to the oath.After that, the Constitution dictates little about how the proceeding should run. It does specify that in presidential impeachments, the chief justice presides for the remainder of the trial.Senate rules in force for three decades dictate that the chamber meets for an impeachment trial every day at 1 p.m., Monday through Saturday, until senators reach a verdict or dismiss the charges.Then comes the haggling.Once they are under oath, senators' first order of business will be wrangling over rules and procedures that dictate the structure of the trial, including whether and when witnesses can be called and documents admitted into evidence. The outcome will set the tone for the coming weeks.Only a simple majority, 51 senators, must agree to set these terms, so Republicans, who hold the Senate majority, come in with a clear advantage.During President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999, senators came together in the Old Senate Chamber to agree on a set of rules to get the trial underway that both sides could support. The rules passed 100 to 0.This time will be far more partisan. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has said he has the votes to push through a rules package based on the one that governed Mr. Clinton's. But he has yet to show anyone a copy, and Democrats have promised to propose amendments in protest, meaning the debate could get messy.Democrats and Republicans have competing objectives and several thorny questions to resolve, including how they should handle some senators' desire to hear from witnesses and collect new evidence, how much time to allow each side to make its case and when to allow senators to move to dismiss the charges.Either in that resolution or separately, the Senate must also send a summons notifying Mr. Trump of the impeachment articles and asking for his formal reply.Opening arguments by the House and White House could last for days.The House managers and White House defense lawyers will most likely have a few days to draw up motions and written legal briefs on their respective arguments to put before the Senate. This will be their first chance to make their cases to senators, and the public.Once all the briefs are in, likely sometime next week, the trial will begin in earnest. The House managers will most likely have a day or more to present the facts of the Ukraine case and their arguments for why Mr. Trump ought to be removed from office.Mr. Trump's defense lawyers will probably be given the same amount of time to present a defense. Because they chose not to mount a defense in the House in the run-up to Mr. Trump's impeachment, it will be the first time the president's team has explicitly responded to the House's allegations and its first opportunity to make a formal argument for why he should remain in office.Senators then have a couple days or so to question both sides. Though the questions are made in writing, the managers and lawyers respond out loud for the whole chamber to hear.The trial will eventually end, one way or another.What comes next is up to the Senate. If a majority of senators support calling witnesses, they could do so, extending the proceeding by weeks or more. In that scenario, a trial could last through the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, and force Mr. Trump to deliver his State of the Union address, scheduled for Feb. 4, while he is on trial in the Senate. (Mr. Clinton did so in 1999.)During the trial, the case can be dismissed altogether by a majority vote. Doing so would certainly give Republican leaders the speedy outcome they want, but it may be hard to secure the 51 votes necessary to do. Republicans made it clear on Monday that they do not have the support of enough senators to move to a dismissal before the trial begins, as Mr. Trump has suggested he wants.More likely, senators will eventually vote on each of the two articles of impeachment. The Constitution stipulates that it takes two-thirds of the Senate, 67 lawmakers, to convict and remove the president from office. Anything short of that will result in acquittal, by far the most likely outcome.PhotographTop, Representative Adam B.

There, she took precedence over four cabinet members and the president's top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who were also in attendance.She also organized Mr. Trump's dinner meeting Tuesday night with global chief executives, and participated in a bilateral meeting with the prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan. She sat for an interview with the Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, and she was the sole adviser Mr. Trump mentioned by name during his 30-minute speech on Tuesday.\"Under Ivanka's leadership, our Pledge to America's Workers has become a full-blown national movement,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to an effort to get employers to expand worker retraining.It was a ringing endorsement in front of a moneyed crowd for a program -- a set of pledges that so far are more promised than realized -- that Ms. Trump has been championing for the past year in lower-profile appearances across the country. After a difficult first year in Washington, during which Ms. Trump struggled to find her lane, the challenges faced by the American worker have given her what she describes as a passion project.Davos was just the latest international gathering in which the president's daughter has taken a major role. And foreign government and business leaders who were once skeptical of her presence -- like her father, she had no background in government -- have recognized the amorphous power held by Mr. Trump's family-members-turned-official-advisers.Ms. Trump used a news conference at Davos about \"reskilling\" workers to promote what she called the president's \"freedom agenda,\" which she claimed was chipping away at income inequality and bringing more women into the labor force. Dressed in a pale blue fitted pantsuit that stood out in a sea of black, she kept to her studiously optimistic message, saying that 400 companies had signed a pledge to expand worker training programs as their industries evolve.\"That's close to 15 million students and workers,\" she said. \"15 million lives impacted, 15 million families impacted.\"In an interview, Ms. Trump said she planned to continue talking about work force development at home, as part of a campaign message that will help her father. She is seen by campaign officials as one of the top fund-raisers and surrogates for the re-election campaign, though she said, \"I've always bristled at the term surrogate,\" which she said suggests merely \"talking about things I haven't been involved in.\"Her draw comes in large part because of her high name recognition across the United States, aides said, and her potential to sway the critical voting block of suburban women with a message about newly enacted benefits that she championed. In the White House, she pushed successfully for an expanded child tax credit -- though much of the benefit goes to well-to-do families -- and paid family leave for federal workers.\"I do think we have a lot of wins on the board the American people don't know about,\" she said.Ms. Trump, however, views herself less as a political voice like her brother Donald Trump, Jr., and more as someone who can mobilize voters and help her father through a focus on two issues the Democrats claim as their own: women's empowerment and the American work force.Ms. Trump said she would \"continue to be focused on the areas where I've helped the president move the ball. I gave up my life to move to Washington to try to help Americans and I'm proud of what we've been able to accomplish.\"Ms. Trump has become a fixture at major international gatherings since she raised hackles at her first one in 2017, when she briefly took her father's chair at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Hamburg, Germany.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan invited her to the Group of 20 meeting last July in Osaka, where she gave a keynote address on women's empowerment, and then delivered a video report on Mr. Trump's dealings with foreign leaders. A brief video from a private gathering, showing her awkward foray into a conversation with the leaders of France, Britain, Canada and the International Monetary Fund, quickly went viral and fed criticism that she was out of her depth.Later, she accompanied Mr. Trump as he crossed the Demilitarized Zone, stepping into North Korea and meeting Kim Jong-un, an experience she described at the time as \"surreal.\"At the Doha Forum, a Middle East conference, Ms. Trump was interviewed onstage by the State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, who came under criticism for asking her questions about her pet project on female entrepreneurship while ignoring the White House's Middle East policy.In Davos, Ms. Trump was careful not to pick a fight with one of the other most prominent female figures attending the World Economic Forum, the Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg. Her father implicitly criticized Ms. Thunberg, saying that climate activists, with their pessimistic messages, were the \"heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers.\"\"I am fundamentally a believer in the power of optimism,\" Ms. Trump said in a phone interview, echoing one of her father's lines.But she added of the 17-year-old Ms. Thunberg, \"I'm not going to criticize anyone who's bringing their energy and voice. That's not my style. I think she's elevated awareness and that's a positive thing.\"Early in the administration, it looked as if Ms. Trump was embracing at least some of Ms. Thunberg's urgency about climate change. During the presidential transition, she brought in former Vice President Al Gore to discuss the issue with Mr. Trump and sat down with Leonardo DiCaprio, who gave her a copy of his documentary, \"Before the Flood.\"But after she and her husband, Jared Kushner, lost an internal debate about withdrawing from the Paris climate accord, she has gone quiet on the issue. In the interview, she placed the emphasis on finding solutions rather than raising alarms.\"I believe in American innovation and global innovation,\" Ms. Trump said, adding that \"only a purely pessimistic outlook is not going to help us solve the problem.\"With the Senate holding a trial on the impeachment of the president, Ms. Trump also expressed frustration about the political and legal quagmire that her father is set to return to in Washington.\"Our actions over the last two weeks have stood in really stark relief against the priorities of others in Congress,\" she said. As for whether the Senate should subpoena witnesses, Ms. Trump remained vague. \"I have an opinion but it would be one voice in many,\" she said, \"so I've largely deferred to the legal team.\"PhotographIvanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter and a White House adviser, arriving for a press conference in Davos on Wednesday.

A constitutional law professor who once defended O.J. Simpson against a murder charge, a former special prosecutor who pursued the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and a litigator for the Christian right.For the third time in American history, the Senate has convened as a court of impeachment to consider whether to remove a sitting president, and two teams of lawyers are facing off in a confrontation with heavy political and constitutional consequences.The seven House Democratic impeachment managers, handpicked by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, have argued that President Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to help smear his political rivals and obstructed Congress to conceal his actions. Mr. Trump's defense team -- drawn from the White House counsel's office and outside lawyers, including a few who frequently appear on television -- has argued that the president did nothing wrong and accused Democrats of using impeachment as a tool to remove an opponent they could not defeat at the ballot box.Here is a look at the opposing legal teams and how they see impeachment, in their own words.The House Impeachment ManagersIn the prior two presidential impeachment trials, all 20 members of the House selected to prosecute the cases -- seven for Andrew Johnson in 1868 and 13 for Bill Clinton in 1999 -- were white men. But the group chosen by Ms. Pelosi includes two African-Americans, a Latina and three women.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead impeachment manager, spoke for as long as the six other managers combined, according to C-SPAN. He spent hours building the House's case by laying out the central themes and then delivering impassioned closing statements that drew grudging praise even from Republicans who disagreed -- along with his share of criticism from those who said they were insulted by his sharp assertions.Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York and Zoe Lofgren of California, both veterans of the Clinton impeachment, drew on historic precedents from the proceedings against him and Johnson. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York recounted the July 25 phone call at the heart of the Democratic case and worked in at least one hip-hop reference -- a signature flourish -- telling senators after he made the case to subpoena Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff: \"And if you don't know, now you know.\" (The line is from \"Juicy,\" a 1994 hit by the Notorious B.I.G.)Representatives Val B. Demings, Jason Crow and Sylvia R. Garcia, all comparatively newer lawmakers, often sought to connect the charges facing Mr. Trump to their own backgrounds. Ms. Demings drew from her experience as a police chief in Florida. Ms. Garcia recalled her time as a judge. And Mr. Crow reflected on his time as an Army Ranger dependent on military resources.Over the allotted three days of presentation -- and another day spent unsuccessfully pushing for subpoenas for additional documents and witnesses -- the seven lawmakers argued that Mr. Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine warranted his removal from office, pointing to what they said was a dangerous pattern of putting his own interests above those of the country.The President's DefenseMr. Trump's defense team includes well-known veteran prosectors from the Clinton era, including Ken Starr, the independent counsel whose report led to the impeachment of Mr. Clinton, and Robert W. Ray, Mr. Starr's successor.Other members include fixtures on Fox News like Alan M. Dershowitz, the celebrity lawyer who defended Mr. Simpson, Claus von Bülow, Mike Tyson and Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who was accused of sex trafficking and killed himself last year in jail.Led by the president's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow and Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, the defense has argued that the House Democrats rushed through the process of impeachment in their zeal to overturn the results of an election they disagreed with, and that there was no evidence in the House case beyond hearsay that Mr. Trump had sought to tie the investigations to release of the security aid.Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Sekulow have been the president's most frequent defenders on the Senate floor, providing most of the arguments against the Democratic effort to vote on subpoenas for documents and witnesses ahead of the team arguments. The crux of their argument is that Mr. Trump is accused of no crime and thus cannot be impeached, a legal theory that is rejected by most constitutional scholars. They also argue that Democrats are seeking to remove the president for policy judgments with which they disagree, thus nullifying the will of voters nine months before the next election.In a remarkable twist, Mr. Starr, known for his aggressive pursuit of Mr. Clinton's impeachment for lying about an affair with a White House intern, told the Senate on Monday that the use of the constitutional remedy should be rare, and that Mr. Trump's actions did not rise to it.Other lawyers on the president's trial team include Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general; Eric D. Herschmann; Michael Purpura and Patrick Philbin, deputy White House counsels; and Jane Serene Raskin, who helped defend Mr. Trump during the investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 election and ties with the Trump campaign.On Monday, Mr. Dershowitz was the only one of the group to directly address the revelations by John R. Bolton in an unpublished manuscript that Mr. Trump directly tied aid to Ukraine aid to investigations of his political rivals. Even if true, Mr. Dershowitz said, it was not impeachable.Photograph(PHOTOGRAPHS BY ERIN SCHAFF) (A16-A17)Word count: 953Show lessYou have requested \"on-the-fly\" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Barr agree on one thing at least: The president is making the attorney general's job much harder. What they don't agree on: Mr. Trump sees no reason to stop.Defying Mr. Barr's pleas, the president renewed his public attacks on law enforcement on Tuesday, denouncing the prosecutors, judge and jury forewoman in the case of his longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr. and defending his convicted former adviser Michael T. Flynn against Mr. Trump's own Justice Department.Explicitly rebuffed, Mr. Barr was left by the end of the day to consider his own future. He expressed dissatisfaction to associates and his irritation soon fed news reports that he was considering resignation if the president continued to publicly weigh in on individual prosecutions of his own associates. But it was unclear whether that would persuade Mr. Trump to back off or only get his back up.The suggestions of resignation came at the end of a day when the president asserted his dominance over a justice system that had long sought to insulate itself from political pressures. Calling himself \"the chief law enforcement officer of the country,\" Mr. Trump demanded a new trial for Mr. Stone, urged federal judges to address the \"tremendous\" abuse of the special counsel investigation of his campaign and bypassed the traditional pardon process to grant clemency to celebrity convicts recommended by his friends, allies and political donors.Mr. Trump insisted he had not directly interfered in the prosecution of advisers like Mr. Stone and Mr. Flynn, but declared again that he had the power to if he wanted and at the very least, he planned to speak out for them. \"You take a look at what's happening to these people,\" he told reporters. \"Somebody has to stick up for the people.\"In doing so, Mr. Trump acknowledged that Mr. Barr was right last week when he said that the president was making it \"impossible\" for him to do his work. \"I do make his job harder,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I do agree with that. I think that's true.\"But while he praised Mr. Barr's \"incredible integrity\" and avowed \"total confidence\" in him, Mr. Trump dismissed the suggestion that he stop discussing individual cases. \"Social media for me has been very important because it gives me a voice, because I don't get that voice in the press,\" he said. \"In the media, I don't get that voice. So I'm allowed to have a voice.\"Even as he refused to take Mr. Barr's advice, Mr. Trump expressed no anger toward his attorney general and some officials said he understood why Mr. Barr felt the need to complain last week to ABC News about the presidential tweets. But The Washington Post reported on Tuesday night that Mr. Barr was thinking about stepping down if the president's tweets continue, a story confirmed by an administration official and seemingly aimed at an audience of one.Mr. Barr was especially irritated by the president's tweet on Tuesday morning denigrating Judge Amy Berman Jackson shortly before she was to hold a conference call with lawyers in Mr. Stone's case. Mr. Trump insisted in his tweet that she order a new trial for Mr. Stone but the Justice Department then disclosed that it opposed just such a retrial, a position personally approved by Mr. Barr.The attorney general then had lunch with Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel and a longtime friend and colleague, in what officials said was a previously scheduled get-together. While Mr. Barr has been incredibly frustrated and has a limit to what he will put up with, people who know him said they doubted he would give in so quickly.An abrupt departure by Mr. Barr would roil a Justice Department on track to deliver several initiatives important to Mr. Trump, including an overhaul of the F.B.I., a criminal investigation into the origins of the Russia inquiry and a continuing leak investigation into James B. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I. It would also leave the president with a vacancy at the top of the Justice Department that might be hard to fill eight months before the election.Mr. Barr has taken heat from critics both inside and outside his department over what they see as the politicization of the law enforcement system. More than 1,100 former Justice Department officials called for Mr. Barr's resignation, and a group representing the nation's federal judges scheduled an emergency telephone conference to address the president's attacks on one of their own.The Justice Department dismissed suggestions on Tuesday night that Mr. Barr's departure was imminent. \"Addressing Beltway rumors: The Attorney General has no plans to resign,\" Kerri Kupec, the department spokeswoman, wrote on Twitter. Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, retweeted Ms. Kupec's message.The president told reporters on Tuesday that Mr. Stone, a longtime friend and off-and-on adviser, and Mr. Flynn, a campaign adviser before serving briefly as his national security adviser, were both \"treated very unfairly.\" He called Mr. Stone's conviction \"a very, very rough thing\" and said that Mr. Flynn's \"life has been destroyed.\"Mr. Stone, who was convicted in November of seven felonies for obstructing a congressional inquiry into the Trump campaign's ties to WikiLeaks, which disseminated Democratic emails stolen by Russian agents, is scheduled to be sentenced on Thursday. Mr. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his dealings with Russian officials but wants to withdraw his plea.Asked whether he was considering pardons for Mr. Stone, Mr. Flynn or Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman convicted on tax and other financial fraud charges, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm not even thinking about that.\" But aides said he had broached the idea and critics said Tuesday's pardons and commutations for convicted political figures like Rod R. Blagojevich and Bernard B. Kerik sent a clear message to the president's associates that he may yet clear them.\"The real test will be, what does this president do with Stone, Manafort and others who are directly connected to him and who have the ability to provide information that is harmful to him?\" said Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as attorney general under President Barack Obama.On Twitter, Mr. Trump cited a \"Fox & Friends\" legal analyst, Andrew Napolitano, who has insisted that the president \"has every right\" to intervene in a criminal case. He quoted Mr. Napolitano's calls for Judge Jackson to reconsider Mr. Stone's case.\"Judge Jackson now has a request for a new trial based on the unambiguous & self outed bias of the foreperson,\" Mr. Trump tweeted, quoting Mr. Napolitano.Judge Jackson ruled Tuesday morning that Mr. Stone's sentencing would go forward as planned on Thursday despite last-ditch motions by his defense lawyers. She said she would allow the defense to file an amended motion for a new trial, give the government a chance to respond with its own filing and schedule a hearing if warranted. Defense lawyers argue that juror misconduct led to an unfair trial.The handling of Mr. Stone's case has generated tumult throughout the Justice Department and grabbed the attention of Washington's broader legal establishment. After Mr. Barr scrapped the original sentencing recommendation in favor of a lighter one, the four career prosecutors handling the matter withdrew from the case and one resigned from the department entirely.As the president has repeatedly pointed out, two of the four prosecutors had worked for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, whose investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election dogged Mr. Trump for two years. The president attacked Mr. Mueller's team anew on Tuesday, saying if he were not president, he would sue it.The president said he had not intervened in Mr. Stone's case, evidently making a distinction between his public commentaries and explicit orders, but added that he had the power to do so if he wanted. \"Just so you understand, I chose not to be involved,\" he said. \"I'm allowed to be totally involved. I'm actually, I guess, the chief law enforcement officer of the country.\"Republican congressional leaders defended Mr. Barr. \"Suggestions from outside groups that the attorney general has fallen short of the responsibilities of his office are unfounded,\" Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California said in a joint statement.Mr. Trump's attacks on Judge Jackson generated alarms in the judiciary. The Federal Judges Association, a voluntary organization, scheduled an emergency telephone conference for this week. Judge Cynthia M. Rufe of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania told USA Today that the group wanted to discuss \"plenty of issues that we are concerned about.\"Mr. Trump countered that the judges should instead investigate misconduct in the Mueller investigation. \"I hope the Federal Judges Association will discuss the tremendous FISA Court abuse that has taken place with respect to the Mueller Investigation Scam, including the forging of documents and knowingly using the fake and totally discredited Dossier before the Court,\" he wrote on Twitter.The role of Mr. Trump's lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani in another politically fraught matter before the Justice Department has also come under scrutiny.Mr. Barr said last week that the department had an \"intake process\" for information from Ukraine, prompting complaints that law enforcement officials were giving Mr. Giuliani special treatment because he has said he turned over evidence against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden, about their dealings in Ukraine.Mr. Giuliani led the campaign to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Biden and other Democrats, a campaign that ultimately led the House to impeach Mr. Trump for abuse of power; he was acquitted this month in a Senate trial.The department routes all Ukraine matters through a central process, not to circumvent channels but to avoid duplicating efforts, Stephen E. Boyd, an assistant attorney general, clarified on Tuesday. The United States attorney in Brooklyn, Richard P. Donoghue, oversees the process, and his counterpart in Pittsburgh, Scott W. Brady, accepts any unsolicited information from the public, including from Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Boyd wrote in a letter to Congress.Michael D.

He was not incorrect.Donald Trump Jr., the president's oldest son, tweeted that Mr. Romney \"is forever bitter\" about losing the presidency and called for him to be \"expelled\" from the Republican Party. Ronna McDaniel, Mr. Romney's niece and the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said that the president had done nothing wrong, the party was \"more united than ever behind him\" -- and that this was not the first time she had disagreed with \"Mitt.\" And President Trump himself tweeted a video attacking Mr. Romney as a \"Democrat secret asset.\"Shortly after 4 p.m. on Wednesday, Mr. Romney voted to convict Mr. Trump of abuse of power for his pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\"Attempting to corrupt an election to maintain power is about as egregious an assault on the Constitution as can be made,\" Mr. Romney said in an interview in his Senate office on Wednesday morning, ahead of the vote and an afternoon floor speech in which he choked up as he explained his decision.He declared Mr. Trump \"guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.\"Mr. Romney did vote with his party against the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress, arguing that House Democrats had failed to exhaust their legal options for securing testimony and other evidence they had sought.Although the final result of the Senate vote had never been in question, the defection of Mr. Romney was a rare cliffhanger in the impeachment proceedings and also a kind of moral sideshow.His vote cast into relief the rapid evolution of the Republican Party into an entity that has wholly succumbed to the vise grip of Mr. Trump. It deprives the president of the monolithic Republican support he had craved at the end of an impeachment case that he has been eager to dismiss as a partisan \"hoax\" perpetrated by Democrats.On the Senate floor on Wednesday, Mr. Romney placed his decision in the context of his faith, his family and how history would remember it.\"I will only be one name among many, no more, no less, to future generations of Americans who look at the record of this trial,\" Mr. Romney said. \"They will note merely that I was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong, grievously wrong.\"In the interview earlier, Mr. Romney, who has been critical of Mr. Trump at various points since 2016, said he was acutely aware that he would suffer serious political ramifications for his decision, particularly in light of the strict loyalty the president has come to expect from elected officials of his own party. No House Republican voted to impeach Mr. Trump in December. (Representative Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan, fled the Republican Party last year over his differences with Mr. Trump and voted in favor of both articles.)\"I recognize there is going to be enormous consequences for having reached this conclusion,\" Mr. Romney said. \"Unimaginable\" is how he described what might be in store for him.Mr. Romney had served as governor of Massachusetts before his unsuccessful run against President Barack Obama in 2012. He then moved to Utah and eventually ran for the Senate. He said he had come under enormous pressure in recent weeks from rank-and-file members of a party whose support for Mr. Trump has become nearly unanimous.\"I don't want to be the skunk at the garden party, and I don't want the disdain of Republicans across the country,\" Mr. Romney said in the interview.He already has endured a great deal of it, namely from Mr. Trump himself, who recently derided Mr. Romney as \"a pompous ass.\" At a grocery store in Florida last weekend, after Mr. Romney voted in favor of calling witnesses to testify in the Senate trial -- another break with Republicans -- he said a man called him a \"traitor,\" while another shouted, \"Stick with the team!\"As of late Wednesday morning, Mr. Romney said he had not yet informed Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, of how he would vote. He added that he made his final decision late last week, after the final round of questions between the senators and the respective sides in the impeachment trial. The magnitude of the matter weighed heavily on him.\"There's not been a morning that I've gotten up after 4 a.m., just obviously thinking about how important this is, what the consequence is,\" Mr. Romney said.Looking back over his political career, Mr. Romney recalled times in which his decisions had been influenced \"in some cases by political benefit.\"\"And I regret that,\" he added, without specifying the particular decisions. He became increasingly reflective as the interview wore on.\"I have found, in business in particular but also in politics, that when something is in your personal best interests, the ability of the mind to rationalize that that's the right thing is really quite extraordinary,\" Mr. Romney said. \"I have seen it in others, and I have seen it in myself.\"As Mr. Romney revealed on the Senate floor how he would cast his votes, Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, dabbed at his eyes.\"I had an instinct,\" he said afterward, \"that this might be a moment.\"\"He's been grappling with it,\" added Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, who sits next to Mr. Romney on the Senate floor. He said he respected Mr. Romney's decision.In his remarks, Mr. Romney called the actions in Ukraine of Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, \"unsavory but also not a crime.\" (Hunter Biden held a seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company at a time when his father was vice president and handling diplomacy with the country.) Mr. Romney added that Mr. Trump's lawyers provided no evidence that a crime was committed by either of the Bidens.\"The president's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit,\" Mr. Romney said. \"There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did.\"As the vote arrived, Mr. Romney sat staring straight ahead, talking to no one, his hands clasped in his lap. When he stood up and declared \"guilty,\" he did so quickly and sat right back down.Moments after the court was adjourned and senators stood up, Mr. Romney shook hands with Mr. Braun, smiled and rushed to the door just feet from his back-row desk, becoming the first senator to leave the chamber.When asked Wednesday morning if he had any special flourishes planned for his speech, Mr. Romney just shrugged. \"I'm planning on tearing it up when I'm finished,\" he quipped, a reference to Speaker Nancy Pelosi's response to the president's State of the Union address Tuesday night.Emily Cochrane and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.Photograph\"I recognize there is going to be enormous consequences for having reached this conclusion,\" Senator Mitt Romney said of his vote to convict President Trump on one of two articles of impeachment.

Biden Jr., the likely Democratic nominee against President Trump in this year's general election, was asked a question during a virtual fund-raiser on Sunday that reflected a challenge looming over his campaign as the coronavirus outbreak intensifies.\"What I'm concerned about is that we see Donald Trump every day with this crisis giving his press report,\" said one donor, according to a pool report from the fund-raiser, which was conducted by telephone. \"And I would just love to see you more. Like, how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?\"Mr. Biden has been taunted by online critics over his relatively low profile since the coronavirus forced him off the campaign trail, with Trump campaign officials and others needling him with the hashtag #WhereIsJoe. The former vice president has not made an appearance on camera in front of the public since he gave a brief live-streamed address from his home on Tuesday, when primaries were held in Florida, Illinois and Arizona.At Sunday's fund-raiser, Mr. Biden said that a recreation room in his home in Delaware had been turned into a television studio, and that he planned to give remarks on Monday. On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Mr. Biden said his campaign was working to increase his ability to speak to the public.\"I want to be in daily or at least, you know, significant contact with the American people and communicate what I would be doing, what I think we should be doing and how we should be doing it,\" Mr. Biden said.Mr. Biden's campaign got off to a rocky start with its efforts at virtual campaigning, as a \"virtual town hall\" with Illinois voters this month was marred by technical problems.At Sunday's virtual fund-raiser, Mr. Biden addressed speculation about whether Mr. Trump would try to postpone the general election because of the coronavirus. (The president does not have that authority.)\"The idea of postponing the electoral process is just, seems to me, out of the question,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I know there's a lot of rumors and speculation as to, 'Is the other guy going to try to postpone the election in November?' and all that. There's no need to do that.\"Mr. Biden also indicated that he was giving serious thought to his potential future running mate, saying that he must \"start that vetting process relatively soon, meaning in a matter of weeks.\"\"There will be a group that is in excess of six or seven people that I look at, because those background checks matter,\" said Mr. Biden, who has gone through the process himself. He expressed hope that \"once I pick someone, God willing if I'm the nominee, that there's not going to be any snafu.\"Mr. Biden's remaining opponent in the primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has also shifted to campaigning virtually. Mr. Sanders held a live-streamed event on the coronavirus from Burlington, Vt., on Sunday, one of several such events he has done in recent days.Since in-person campaigning came to a halt, Mr. Biden and his team have weighed in repeatedly about the coronavirus, sharply criticizing Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis. But he has struggled to break through given the flood of news about the outbreak, and he lacks the kind of platform that is available to Mr. Trump, who has appeared daily at White House briefings on the virus.Mr. Biden gave a speech about the coronavirus this month and released a plan for responding to the outbreak, and on Friday's conference call with reporters, he urged the president to \"stop saying false things.\" But in the past week, he has been largely out of sight even as his campaign presses its case against Mr. Trump over his handling of the crisis.Mr. Biden's team has issued a number of written statements and has posted repeatedly on social media about the subject. His campaign released a video in which Ronald Klain, a former chief of staff to Mr. Biden who served as the Ebola response coordinator in the Obama White House, stands in front of a white board and discusses Mr. Trump's handling of the virus and how Mr. Biden would respond. The video has now been seen four million times on Twitter.Another video from the Biden campaign alternates between playing footage of Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden speaking about the coronavirus. \"This moment calls for a president,\" the video says at the end. \"In November, you can elect one.\"A spokesman for the Trump campaign, Matt Wolking, on Sunday accused Mr. Biden of seeking to use the coronavirus for \"political gain at the exact moment the country needs optimism and unity.\"\"It's also cowardly -- because instead of showing his own face, Biden is having his advisers and allies do most of his dirty work for him,\" he said.Sydney Ember and Katie Glueck contributed reporting.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Wilmington, Del., this month. The coronavirus outbreak has forced him, Senator Bernie Sanders and President Trump to cancel in-person events in the presidential race.

Grassley of Iowa administered the oath to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in the well of the Senate, asking him to swear \"that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States,\" he would deliver impartial justice.At the White House at that precise moment, President Trump was scheduled to be hosting an event promoting the administration's attempt to empower religious students to exercise their rights to pray at school. But for the next hour as, one by one, 99 senators signed the oath book, the president kept the students waiting. Finally, he allowed reporters into the Oval Office, where he sat behind the Resolute Desk and took their questions.The day before, Mr. Trump had presided over a celebration of a trade deal with China, calling out some of the nation's biggest corporate leaders as if they were his golf buddies. Earlier Thursday, the Senate had given final approval to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Now he had to talk about the attempt to remove him from office.\"I did the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country yesterday in terms of trade,\" he said, referring to (and exaggerating the size of) the China deal, \"and that was the second story to a total hoax. Today, we just had passed the U.S.M.C.A. It's going to take the place of NAFTA, which was a terrible deal, and the U.S.M.C.A. will probably be second to this witch hunt hoax, which hopefully everyone knows is not going anywhere.\"The president claimed that he did not know Lev Parnas, an associate of his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani who said in interviews this week that the president knew everything about the effort to push Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, as well as the 2016 election, the reason for his impeachment.He described Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the Intelligence Committee chairman who had read the articles of impeachment to the assembled Senate, as \"a corrupt person. He's a corrupt politician.\"He said the entire impeachment inquiry was \"a hoax,\" adding, \"Everybody knows that.\"Referring to a July phone call he had with the president of Ukraine that helped touch off the impeachment inquiry, he said Democrats \"picked up a phone call that was perfect, but they didn't know it was perfect.\"And then, minutes after dismissing the reporters from the Oval Office, Mr. Trump issued the Twitter version of a shout.\"I JUST GOT IMPEACHED FOR MAKING A PERFECT PHONE CALL!\" he wrote.The all-caps tweet only underscored how Mr. Trump has become increasingly unnerved by the prospect of a Senate trial, even one in which his Republican allies are widely expected to acquit him. And by the few times the president did anything in public on Thursday, it was clear he was looking for ways to do something about it.On Twitter, he gave an unusual plug to Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who is retiring at the end of the year and has said he may vote to hear from more witnesses during the Senate impeachment trial.Mr. Trump appeared to offer his conditional support for a bill introduced by Mr. Alexander that would award the Congressional Gold Medal to a Tennessee native, Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds, an American prisoner of war who helped save Jewish lives during World War II. \"Looking at this strongly!\" the president tweeted.Democrats need four Republican votes to force the Senate to subpoena witnesses like John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, to testify, and Mr. Alexander is one of four who have signaled a potential openness to breaking ranks.The president's school prayer event appeared to be a direct appeal to the evangelical Christians who are an important part of his political base.There was very little new to announce, and the American Civil Liberties Union called the guidance issued Thursday a \"copycat document\" almost identical to one released by the George W. Bush administration in 2003, which reinforces existing legal parameters for schools that receive federal funding to allow students to pray individually and in groups. But Mr. Trump framed the new guidelines as a landmark, saying that there was a \"growing totalitarian impulse on the far left that seeks to punish, restrict and even prohibit religious expression\" and said that the new guidance ensures the \"right to pray.\"The president capped his day with a meeting with several campaign aides, where he grilled them on how voters were receiving impeachment.In his conversations with advisers on Thursday, Mr. Trump repeated once again that he could not believe he was facing such a predicament as impeachment. He said he wanted people to be prepared for a motion to dismiss and has hoped for one, even though Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, has said the Senate will have to take up the matter.At different times, Mr. Trump has also told aides he wants the opportunity to call witnesses he believes could help him politically, like Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden's son, as well as the whistle-blower, a C.I.A. officer who first alerted the Intelligence Committee to Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on the Ukrainian government.Mr. Trump, always concerned about optics and how things play, has also expressed reservations about whether his lawyers will be aggressive enough during the televised Senate trial.Mr. McConnell has advised the president that the best trial is a short one and that witnesses can only create more unknowns.On a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, senior Trump officials said it would be extraordinarily unlikely for a trial to take longer than a few weeks, calling theirs an easy case, even as new details about Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine have continued to come out.In a meeting with conservative leaders at the White House the same day, two officials who have become the public face of the White House impeachment response, Tony Sayegh and Pam Bondi, said much the same thing.Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, meanwhile, used the events of the day as a fund-raising opportunity, directing voters through targeted digital ads to an \"official impeachment defense fund,\" which acted as a portal to the campaign's website.The message delivered from Mr. Trump online was simple: \"FIGHT BACK.\"Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographPresident Trump's Twitter feed showed that he was paying close attention to his political future.

The president said he was interested in awarding Mr. Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom. On Tuesday evening during his address, Mr. Trump did just that, with the first lady, Melania Trump, presenting the medal to a surprised Mr. Limbaugh in the gallery.In a jovial mood after Iowa Democrats botched Monday's caucus vote count -- a situation that Mr. Trump happily called a \"fiasco\" -- the president held court for nearly two hours on Tuesday afternoon over a lunch of sole and soup in the State Dining Room. Vice President Mike Pence and Ivanka Trump also attended.The conversation, an annual tradition for anchors, is off the record, but as in past years, multiple people described Mr. Trump's remarks after the fact. Journalists from The New York Times were not invited and did not agree to those off-the-record terms.The White House declined to discuss the president's remarks. \"I actually have ethics so I'm not going to comment on an off-the-record lunch,\" said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary.The president had tough words for John Bolton, his former national security adviser, complaining that Mr. Bolton wanted to be referred to as \"ambassador\" and saying that Mr. Bolton \"turned on me\" by writing a book that includes unflattering portrayals of Mr. Trump's behavior.As for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who will stand on the dais beside Mr. Pence during the State of the Union, Mr. Trump said the two had not spoken in some time. \"There's one person behind me who's going to be friendly and one who's not going to be friendly,\" the president said, referring to his Tuesday evening address.With a Diet Coke at his side, Mr. Trump spoke of his regret about Mr. Limbaugh's medical diagnosis, saying that he had recently spoken with the talk-radio host and Mr. Limbaugh had offered no hint of his illness.Asked about this fall's general election debates, Mr. Trump repeated his recent complaints that \"Never Trumpers\" sit on the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonpartisan group that organizes the events. But the president said he had decided to participate, because he believed his debate performances helped him win support from voters in the 2016 campaign.The annual anchor lunch predates Mr. Trump's administration. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump broke from precedent by declining to invite journalists from CNN, a network that he routinely accuses of bias.Chuck Todd, the moderator of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" told Mr. Trump at the lunch that he was asking a question on behalf of the CNN anchor Jake Tapper, according to another person familiar with the exchange. The president responded by saying that journalists from \"MSDNC\" -- his recently adopted nickname for MSNBC -- were also absent, though Mr. Todd hosts a daily afternoon show for the cable network.Mr. Trump often castigates news outlets and individual reporters in public, contributing to a hostile environment toward journalists that press freedom groups have called dangerous and encouraging to autocrats who suppress independent media. But the president was described as cordial and easygoing at Tuesday's event.PhotographPresident Trump is said to be considering awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh.

He said that the issue came up during the weekly closed-door meeting of committee leaders.Democrats believe they won back the House majority in 2018 with a laser focus on health care and the economy. But they are also revolted by an unrepentant president and reluctant to abandon investigations into his conduct that might yield evidence of wrongdoing. With Mr. Trump emboldened by his acquittal, some say investigating him is more important than ever.Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed ready to make a pivot on Thursday, less than 24 hours after the Senate verdict that he was not guilty ended a five-month impeachment drama that consumed the Capitol.At her weekly news conference, Ms. Pelosi spent the bulk of her opening remarks talking about Mr. Trump's State of the Union address -- \"appalling,\" she said -- and pushing back on his claims that he is responsible for the nation's economic turnaround.But she also vowed not to let up on oversight of his policies and personal conduct.\"We will continue to do our oversight to protect and defend the Constitution,\" Ms. Pelosi said.Putting that into practice may prove fraught. Democratic leaders must decide in the coming days whether to carry on with the investigation into Mr. Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, which led the House to impeach the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.The biggest question at the moment is whether to issue a subpoena for John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, after senators refused to consider new testimony in the impeachment trial. Doing so could yield damaging new information, but it also risks making Democrats look like sore losers.On Wednesday, Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman and an impeachment manager, said that the House should subpoena Mr. Bolton, who has written a tell-all book that contains a direct account of Mr. Trump's decision to leverage nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine in exchange for the investigations.But Democrats also recognize that Mr. Bolton may be less receptive to speaking to the House now that Mr. Trump has been acquitted. On Thursday, Neither Ms. Pelosi nor Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the House Intelligence Committee chairman and the leader of the impeachment prosecution team, would say what they intend to do.\"We really haven't made any decisions yet,\" Mr. Schiff said.Some of the Democrats' long-running investigations into Mr. Trump are continuing quietly, and others are proceeding in the federal courts, where the House is party to a handful of consequential legal fights over access to Mr. Trump's tax returns, other financial information and witness testimony and documents related to Robert S. Mueller III's Russia investigation.Several of the fights could go to the Supreme Court and perhaps be decided before November's elections. If Democrats were to win access, say, to Mr. Trump's federal tax returns, or a court forced Donald F. McGahn II, the former White House counsel, to testify about Mr. Trump's attempts to thwart the Russia investigation, it could produce a new round of high-profile hearings about whether the president had broken the law -- an inquiry that would surely reverberate in the presidential campaign.Lower-profile work by the House Oversight and Reform, Judiciary and Foreign Affairs committees has scrutinized the Trump administration's border policies, the decision to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census, politicization of the State Department and the responses to devastating hurricanes in the Caribbean.But the question is one of emphasis, and how Democrats answer it could shape voters' views of them heading into the next election. Representative Donna Shalala, Democrat of Florida, who served as health secretary to President Bill Clinton, repeated a single phrase when asked what Democrats should do next.\"Health care, health care, health care,\" said Ms. Shalala, who is working on legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and to end surprise medical billing.As is the case with most intraparty Democratic debates, moderates and progressives fall into different camps. Moderates want to talk to voters about \"kitchen table\" issues. Progressives want to send the message that the House will continue to act as a check on a president clearly emboldened by his acquittal.\"People in Wisconsin, people in Michigan, people in Ohio, people in Pennsylvania, people in North Carolina, they're going to vote for their member of Congress or a president based on what that party is focused on,\" said Representative Tim Ryan, a centrist Democrat from Ohio. \"They are focused on their own economic situation. They will punish a party that is not focused on those issues.\"But progressives like Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Jamie Raskin of Maryland said that Democrats should redouble their efforts to rein in Mr. Trump.\"We must make sure that this administration does not continue to break the law,\" Ms. Omar said.Mr. Raskin framed it this way: \"We have the exact same oversight duties and powers as we did before. He also has not won himself the right to commit high crimes and misdemeanors against the Constitution and the people.\"Even so, there were signs on Thursday that the House's marquee inquiries will shift into a lower gear. Norman L. Eisen and Barry H. Berke, who served as special counsels to the Judiciary Committee for its long-running abuse of power investigation and then formed part of its core impeachment team, are both expected to depart in the coming weeks.The internal discussion over next steps comes as the relationship between Mr. Trump and Ms. Pelosi has hit a new low, raising questions about whether it is even possible for them to work together on legislative matters. Both the president and the speaker have said that they want legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and to fix the nation's crumbling infrastructure.But if the events of Thursday were any guide, they can barely stand to be in the same room with one another. At a White House celebration of his acquittal, Mr. Trump boasted about having taken a shot at Ms. Pelosi during the National Prayer Breakfast earlier that day.\"I had Nancy Pelosi sitting four seats away, and I said things that a lot of people wouldn't have said,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But I meant every one of them.\"At the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi shot back, saying Mr. Trump looked \"a little sedated\" at the State of the Union. \"That was not a State of the Union,\" she said. \"That was his state of his mind.\"As Democrats contemplated the road ahead, Republicans were giddy, portraying the House's failed impeachment case as a misguided overreach.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, called impeachment \"a colossal political mistake.\" Americans, he said, \"are more likely to focus at this point and for the rest of the year on, what kind of shape is the country in? How are you feeling about things? Are you better off now than you were four years ago?\"PhotographSpeaker Nancy Pelosi spent the bulk of her opening remarks at her weekly press conference talking about President Trump's State of the Union address.

In 2015 he lost his shot at the speaker's gavel after he said the quiet part out loud: The true purpose of Republicans' two-year inquiry into a deadly 2012 attack on the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, was to dent Hillary Clinton's poll numbers.But in these times, when such impolitic truths are uttered often by the commander in chief, Mr. McCarthy has found a moment. He stayed on as the House Republicans' No. 2 after failing to grab the speakership, rising to the conference's top spot last year after Paul D. Ryan retired amid the anti-Trump wave of 2018, which handed the speaker's gavel to Nancy Pelosi.Unburdened by Mr. Ryan's strong ideologies or the self-certainty of a Newt Gingrich, Mr. McCarthy has become the happy warrior of the age, one colleague said, posing for photographs with players in the Ukraine saga, like Lev Parnas, shouting encouragement to his compatriots from his leadership perch and shepherding a fractious Republican conference behind President Trump, wrecker of Republican tradition.\"Congress no longer operates as an independent branch of government, but as an appendage of the executive branch,\" said Tom Davis, a former Republican House member from Virginia. \"He is made for that role.\"In recent weeks, Mr. McCarthy has called House impeachment \"a national nightmare,\" \"rigged\" and a \"last attempt to stop the Trump presidency.\" He claimed the F.B.I. \"broke into\" Mr. Trump's campaign in a \"modern-day Watergate.\" He suggested that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should suspend campaigning while many of his top rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, sit as captive jurors in the impeachment trial.His delivery lacks the razor edge of his fellow House Republican leader Liz Cheney, who announced on Thursday that she would forgo a campaign for Wyoming's open Senate seat to remain in the House, a veiled threat to challenge Mr. McCarthy for the speakership if Republicans regain the majority. He never attains the volume of Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who has challenged him for Republican leadership posts, or the umbrage of Representative Devin Nunes, a Republican from the California district next door.\"He's a nice guy,\" said Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, with a verbal shrug.Five minutes later, Mr. Massie texted an additional thought: \"I can say this about Kevin, he's been far more helpful to the president than Paul Ryan would have ever been during this impeachment sham.\"For now, that may be his main job: making the president happy.\"Where is Kevin McCarthy, the great Kevin McCarthy?\" Mr. Trump demanded last week at a China trade event at the White House. When it was clear the minority leader was in the House, preparing for the vote to send articles of impeachment to the Senate, the president added: \"Kevin McCarthy, as you know, left for the hoax. Well, we have to do that; otherwise, it becomes a more serious hoax.\"It is no small thing to the president that Mr. McCarthy kept House Republicans unified in their opposition to Mr. Trump's impeachment. House Republicans include \"former prosecutors who probably don't love the president, moderates who are retiring and thinking, 'I'm going to vote to impeach the president because I want my grandchildren to talk to me again,\"' said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. \"That they didn't is a significant victory for the president, and a significant victory for Kevin McCarthy.\"Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said House Republicans had gained confidence in their leader since he flubbed the speakership and forced leaders to dragoon Mr. Ryan into action.\"I can't see him making that Hillary Clinton mistake again,\" Mr. King said. \"He's able to get his point across without damaging the party.\"\"It's really brutal warfare right now, and any sign of seeming too reasonable or conciliatory could scare off the Republican base and be looked upon as weakness by the Democrats,\" he continued. \"These aren't normal times. Today, if you make a deal you're a sellout.\"Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, noted, \"We need to have a productive relationship with the president.\"The impeachment saga has, however, most likely tainted Mr. McCarthy. Late last year, his awkward defense of the president in the Ukraine affair on \"60 Minutes\" -- he appeared unfamiliar with the rough transcript of Mr. Trump's now-infamous call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine -- prompted Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, who left the Republican Party last year over the president's conduct, to tweet, \"Kevin McCarthy again displays his unique brand of incompetence and dishonesty.\"Photographs have trickled out in recent days showing the minority leader hobnobbing with characters central to Mr. Trump's effort to enlist Ukraine in discrediting Mr. Biden. Those include Mr. Parnas, an associate of the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and Robert F. Hyde, a Republican congressional candidate who suggested in encrypted messages to Mr. Parnas that he was secretly tracking the United States ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie L. Yovanovitch.Ms. Pelosi could not resist taking a dig at Mr. McCarthy on the House floor last week when she referred to \"new evidence, pursuant to a House subpoena, from Lev Parnas -- recently photographed with the Republican leader.\"On Thursday, Mr. McCarthy could not hide his frustration with a reporter, Adam Klasfeld of Courthouse News, when he asked the leader to explain exactly what he had done with Mr. Parnas's campaign contributions, a question Mr. McCarthy said the reporter asks \"every week.\"\"I do events every single day, and I do pictures with thousands of people all the time,\" he said during one of his exchanges with Mr. Klasfeld, adding that he donated Mr. Parnas's contributions \"to charity.\" He has repeatedly declined to say which ones.Asked whether Mr. McCarthy would agree to be interviewed for this article, his spokesman, Matt Sparks, said, \"I'm trying to figure out what he could say that might be interesting.\"That was a question on the mind of some of his political opponents. After Mr. McCarthy suggested that the impeachment trial was a way for establishment Democrats to hurt Mr. Sanders's presidential campaign, Ms. Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter, \"As usual, the Minority Leader has no idea what he's talking about.\"Charlie Dent, a former Republican House member from Pennsylvania, suggested the unsolicited advice to the Democrats was a way to damage Mr. Biden. \"This is Kevin McCarthy's way of invading the Democratic primary, and helping the president,\" he said. \"That's why he's wandered into this minefield.\"Beneath the bravado, Mr. McCarthy may be feeling the walls closing in on him. After Republicans' 2018 midterm shellacking, he is one of only a half-dozen Republicans left in California's 53-member House delegation. There were 19 elected in 2006, when he first won his seat.He must protect his right flank from a restive Freedom Caucus, which counts as one of its founders Mr. Jordan, a ferocious Trump acolyte who helped derail Mr. McCarthy's bid for the speakership in 2015. Last week, the minority leader's confines grew even cozier with Ms. Cheney's political decision.All this, plus Mr. McCarthy must retain favor with the mercurial Mr. Trump, who makes his displeasure with recalcitrant Republican lawmakers known in ways that have cost them their jobs.The son of a firefighter, Mr. McCarthy, 54, hails from a solidly Republican, middle-class district in California's agricultural interior. He was initially skeptical of Mr. Trump: He once suggested that the president-to-be was on the payroll of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.But as Mr. Trump tightened his grip on the party's base, Mr. McCarthy wooed him with gestures large and small. During the 2016 campaign, he played mediator with outraged Republicans after Mr. Trump was heard bragging about sexual assault on an \"Access Hollywood\" tape. He issued a statement heralding \"a new period in our country's great history\" after Mr. Trump's \"American carnage\" inauguration speech. He threw a big party at the Trump International Hotel (Mr. Trump did not show up, despite high hopes) and he sent a handpicked supply of Mr. Trump's favorite cherry and strawberry Starburst candies to the White House.In 2010, Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Ryan and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia were hailed as the young, hip, fit future of their party. In their book, \"Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders,\" they portrayed themselves as \"reform-minded Republicans\" who were \"eager to erase the image of congressional Republicans as big spenders preoccupied with assuring their own re-election.\"Today, Mr. Cantor and Mr. Ryan are gone, along with many of their small-government, free-market, pro-trade ideals, replaced by Mr. Trump's crackdown on immigrants, his protectionist tariffs, and tax cut and spending deals that have ballooned the federal deficit. Used copies of \"Young Guns\" sell on Amazon for 10 cents, and Mr. McCarthy is very much focused on his conference's re-election campaigns, hopping from fund-raiser to fund-raiser late into the night.\"The difference between Eric and Paul and Kevin is that Kevin really likes politics,\" Mr. Feehery said. \"He's not particularly ideological, he likes to backslap with his colleagues, and he likes to get around and raise money.\"Mike Franc, a former McCarthy policy aide, remembered Mr. McCarthy serving staff members fast-food Italian during late-night votes and developing a minor obsession with Vine, the now-defunct six-second video app, playing with it for hours in his office.If the Young Guns' personalities represented parts of a meal, Mr. Franc said, Mr. Ryan would be \"vegetables\" and Mr. Cantor \"good fish.\" Mr. McCarthy, he said, \"is the maître d'.\"PhotographRepublicans credit Representative Kevin McCarthy with unifying the opposition in the House to President Trump's impeachment.

Bloomberg for president, a high-profile defection that Mr. Bloomberg's allies hope will convince Democratic voters that their best chance of defeating Mr. Trump is the former mayor of New York.Richard V. Spencer, who was ousted as Navy secretary in November after he publicly disagreed with Mr. Trump's intervention in an extraordinary war crimes case involving a member of the Navy SEALs, is a lifelong Republican.In a telephone interview, he said he had never before voted for a Democrat, but was ready to do so now. His support could help the argument by Mr. Bloomberg that, as a successful businessman himself, he is uniquely qualified to take on Mr. Trump and become the next commander in chief.\"We need a leader who can bring the country together,\" Mr. Spencer said, rather than the \"cleaving\" that he said had occurred under the stewardship of his former boss.\"This is not about a party. This is not about left and right. It's about where can we find a solution to get the country working together and be unified, with an operable political system,\" he said.On Friday, Mr. Spencer, a former Marine, will join Mr. Bloomberg in Norfolk, Va., where the Democratic presidential hopeful will unveil his plan to address the economic and health concerns of veterans and military families. The area hosts major military bases, and is a favorite location for retired members of the armed services.Military communities are an important constituency in a number of Super Tuesday states, including Virginia.The endorsement of Mr. Spencer is significant because, as a former Trump political appointee, he is an embodiment of what many view as Mr. Bloomberg's greatest potential asset: that the candidate can make inroads with Republican voters in the November general election.In recent days, Mr. Bloomberg, whose campaign is fueled by a multibillion-dollar personal fortune, has authorized his campaign team to double his spending on television commercials in every market where he is advertising and expand his field staff to more than 2,000 people.Mr. Bloomberg's route to the Democratic nomination has so far veered sharply from those of his competitors. He is skipping the first four contests in February but is aggressively contesting the array of larger states that begin voting in March.While most Americans usually have no clue who the Navy secretary is, Mr. Spencer was at the center of one of Mr. Trump's most explosive confrontations with the Pentagon.In November, Mr. Trump, over the objections of senior Pentagon officials -- including Mr. Spencer -- reversed the demotion of a Navy SEAL commando, Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, and pardoned two other service members who were accused of war crimes.Mr. Spencer and top military leaders had sought to punish the three, arguing that leniency would affect morale, harm American troops in the field and undermine discipline. But the men were lionized by conservative commentators who portrayed them as war heroes unfairly prosecuted for actions taken in the heat of battle.Mr. Spencer threatened to resign, and Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper took him up on the offer. The case dominated headlines in the days before Mr. Bloomberg began campaigning, and he addressed the blowup in his opening public remarks as a candidate at an event in Norfolk. Mr. Bloomberg derided Mr. Trump as a lawless leader and quoted Mr. Spencer's resignation letter.\"I salute Secretary Spencer for not flinching from his duties,\" Mr. Bloomberg said at the time. \"But the fact remains, we have a president, a commander in chief, who has no respect for the rule of law and no concern whatsoever for ethics or honor, or for the values that truly make America great.\"For his part, Chief Gallagher traveled in December to Mar-a-Lago, the president's resort in Florida, to personally thank Mr. Trump for his help, and officials close to the president have said that they want the commando to campaign alongside Mr. Trump this year.If that happens, Mr. Spencer could have an opportunity to make a powerful counterpoint.Bloomberg aides said the former mayor would present a plan on Friday in Norfolk that would seek to protect military families from the threat of deportation and provide service members with a fast track to naturalization for green card holders serving in the military.If elected, Mr. Bloomberg also would reverse Mr. Trump's ban on transgender people serving in the military and would eliminate co-pays for preventive health care services for veterans.PhotographRichard Spencer, President Trump's former Navy secretary, will join Michael R.

Instead, he heaped praise on his administration's response when in reality, his attempts to play down the health crisis have been under fierce criticism for weeks.There were also surprising -- and significant -- inaccuracies in the speech, which administration officials and the president had to clarify almost immediately afterward. Mr. Trump said in his address he would suspend \"all travel from Europe to the United States,\" but the ban in fact applies to foreign citizens. And while he said the measure would \"apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo\" across the ocean, the order in fact affects only people.Throughout his 10-minute, uncharacteristically formal address, Mr. Trump struggled to find a middle ground between acknowledging the deepening crisis and diminishing its threat to the country's future.\"This is not a financial crisis,\" he said. \"This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world.\"The speech capped a day when concerns about the risk of the virus seemed to reach a new pitch and measures to protect vulnerable populations began to upend the rhythms of daily life across the country -- many schools announced they would close indefinitely, some nursing homes barred visitors, and workplaces across the country urged their employees to work from home.But his measured tone belied the frustration Mr. Trump has been venting behind closed doors in recent days over the spread of the coronavirus, the tumbling financial markets it has caused and the blame he has directed at Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, for not making more moves to reduce the economic effect.Despite handing over the coronavirus portfolio to Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Trump has been unable to let it go as he has watched the stock market plunge and the economy he has pinned his re-election hopes on suddenly falter. But it was Mr. Pence who played the biggest role in moving Mr. Trump to give a more forceful public statement, over many days, according to White House officials.Until Wednesday, Mr. Trump's response to the pandemic had been defined mostly by his own wishful thinking that projecting a \"business as usual\" approach would calm nerves and reassure the stock market.But the day's events convinced Mr. Trump that it was time for a response, prompting the president to upend his schedule, which included a private dinner at the residence of Mr. Pence, who also canceled a scheduled news briefing with the coronavirus task force to allow Mr. Trump to deliver the administration's message of the day.After Mr. Trump's speech, Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary, also announced the cancellation of the president's planned trip this week to Colorado and Las Vegas, citing \"an abundance of caution from the coronavirus outbreak.\"Privately, the president has complained to advisers that he can no longer campaign for re-election the way he would like and insisted that concerns about the virus have been overblown.Mr. Trump had been particularly insistent on sticking with his plans for Las Vegas, where he was scheduled to address a large gathering of supporters on Saturday at the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas. His appearance there was only scrapped late Wednesday night and organizers earlier in the day said they had been told Mr. Trump planned to attend.Earlier in the week, Mr. Trump also had to be persuaded by several advisers to hold off on announcing a campaign rally in Florida that was scheduled for the end of March.\"It will go away, just stay calm,\" the president said Tuesday after meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill, even as officials on his own coronavirus task force had publicly contradicted his \"nothing to see here\" message in a way that has rarely been seen before in the administration.Mr. Trump's first public response to the health crisis was on Jan. 31, when the administration announced it would bar entry by most foreign citizens who had recently visited China, and put some American travelers under a quarantine as it declared a rare public health emergency.The move was considered a significant step at the time, and Mr. Trump was lauded by Republicans for taking what some described as an unprecedented action to contain the spread of the virus.But officials have since conceded that those efforts at containment have not prevented the virus from spreading within communities around the United States.And as that spread has increased, Mr. Trump's administration has been criticized for a decision to dismantle a branch of the National Security Council devoted exclusively to global pandemics, and for a shortage of coronavirus test kits that until this week made it impossible to identify anyone who was infected.For his part, Mr. Trump has continually made false statements and misinformed the public about the severity of a virus that has left at least 37 people in the United States dead. Instead, his focus has been on repeating how well he thinks the response has gone rather than focusing on the response itself.Speaking last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, where many lawmakers were exposed to an attendee infected with the virus, Mr. Trump said that his administration's response \"has been now given very good grades, like an A +++.Mr. Trump has claimed, falsely, that the number of cases in the United States would go down to \"close to zero.\" He has been fact-checked in real time by members of his own coronavirus task force, for stating falsely that a vaccine would be available \"relatively soon.\"And in his address Wednesday night, Mr. Trump repeated another theme -- that he viewed the virus as something that was inflicted upon him from a foreign country. He wanted to discuss \"our nation's unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world,\" he said.Over the past month, Mr. Trump has been grasping at strands of good news in his briefings. In February, for instance, he repeated something he picked up in one: that viruses do not spread as fast in warmer temperatures.\"A lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News last month. In reality, however, it is not clear how coronavirus will change with the weather. And Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told members of Congress on Wednesday that when it came to the virus, \"we have got to assume it is going to get worse and worse and worse.\"Behind the scenes, Mr. Kushner has taken an increasingly active role in the coronavirus response, and spent the day with the president on Wednesday.But he has also been among a small group of White House advisers who have reinforced Mr. Trump's belief that the news media is exaggerating the threat of the virus in an effort to damage the president, according to people familiar with the conversations in the West Wing.Republicans who have clashed with the White House said they remained skeptical about what the president could accomplish, even as he claimed on Twitter that he was \"prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government\" to confront the challenge posed by coronavirus.\"For the foreseeable future, people are going to be looking for steady leadership and effective management, neither of which are his calling card,\" said Brendan Buck, a former aide to Speaker Paul D. Ryan. \"We don't know how long this will last or how bad it will be.\"Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographPresident Trump announcing travel restrictions Wednesday during a speech from the Oval Office.

That's the most positive that respondents have been about the economy in the three years the survey has been conducted.Other measures of consumer confidence have likewise shown a strong rebound in recent months after falling last summer amid headlines warning of a looming recession.Views of the economy remain sharply divided along partisan lines, as they have throughout Mr. Trump's presidency. That could dampen the impact of the economy on the election because many voters may view economic news through the lens of their existing political preferences.But recent gains in confidence have been particularly strong among the voters most likely to be swayed by economic news: independents. True independents -- those who say they do not lean toward either major party -- had the biggest jump in confidence in the new Times survey.In a recent survey from The Washington Post and ABC News, 60 percent of independents said Mr. Trump was doing a good job with the economy, up from 46 percent in September.The increase in confidence among independents is a recent development and might not last. And some sources tell a different story: A long-running measure of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan showed on Friday that confidence rose over all in January but fell slightly among independents, although confidence is up sharply among all partisan groups since the fall.The economy's performance is swaying some voters. Samuel Knight did not vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 because he and his evangelical Christian family did not like his personal behavior. But he said that if the election were held today, he would pull the lever for Mr. Trump, largely because of the strong economy.\"It's probably the No. 1 thing that influences my vote,\" he said.Mr. Knight, who runs a start-up in Dallas that makes software for the construction industry, said he was not sure how much credit Mr. Trump deserved for the strong economy. But he said his customers have benefited from the administration's efforts to ease regulation, and he said he supported the president's approach on trade, even though it had driven up some costs.\"I think we have the resources to outlast China, hands down,\" he said. \"I think it's a smart move.\"Republicans are counting on voters like Mr. Knight to carry Mr. Trump to victory in November. The president routinely promotes strong economic data and the rising stock market in speeches and at rallies.\"Are you better off now than you were three years ago?\" he asked on Twitter on Tuesday. \"Almost everyone says YES!\"That argument ran into trouble over the summer when turmoil in financial markets and escalating trade tensions with China and other countries led to a surge in news coverage warning of a possible recession. Measures of consumer confidence fell in September and were slow to rebound.Economic growth cooled last year, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Thursday, and forecasters expect momentum to slow further in 2020. Still, recession fears have ebbed in recent months, as the job market has remained strong and the Federal Reserve has taken steps to prevent damage from the trade war from spreading to the broader economy. Now confidence appears to be rebounding as well.\"There was this dark cloud hanging over us, but a lot of that has lifted,\" said Joseph Song, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. He noted that wage growth had been picking up among lower-income workers, which could further bolster their economic outlook.Another factor could also be driving confidence: the stock market.Mr. Trump frequently cites the rising market as evidence that his policies are working. Experts generally reject that argument: Most Americans own few stocks, and the relationship between stock prices and economic growth is erratic at best. But research has found that the performance of major stock indexes can have a powerful influence on consumers' outlook.\"It's something that is very public,\" Mr. Song said. \"It's the one broad measure that everyone knows to follow.\"Still, it is not clear whether rising confidence will translate into more votes for Mr. Trump. Economic conditions have traditionally been among the best predictors of presidential elections. But Mr. Trump's approval rating is significantly weaker than past presidents' during similar periods of economic strength.\"The fact that we're not seeing a corresponding uptick in presidential approval, that shows that the question of whether the economy will be less of a factor than in typical elections is still very much an open question,\" said Peter K. Enns, who leads the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University.Debi Mazur-Hofmann is an independent voter outside Allentown, Pa. -- a part of the country that could prove pivotal in this fall's election. She said the economy was \"amazingly great,\" at least based on the stock market and the unemployment rate, and she said Mr. Trump probably deserved some credit.\"He's done a good job regarding what we see in front of our eyes,\" she said. \"He did a lot for the people who are working, possibly.\"But Ms. Mazur-Hofmann, 61, doubts the good times will last. She worries about the national debt and fears Mr. Trump will cut Social Security. And even if the economy remains strong, Ms. Mazur-Hofmann said, she will not vote for Mr. Trump in November because of how he treats people.\"I'll never vote for Trump -- never, never, never in a million years,\" she said.Democrats on the campaign trail have not shied away from talking about the economy, although they describe it in very different terms than Mr. Trump does. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in particular, have run on policies that they say would reduce inequality and make the economy fairer. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has pledged to rebuild the middle class.Liberal groups are urging Democratic candidates to frame economic issues this year in a matter that could counter Mr. Trump's appeals.A national poll released this week by Navigator Research, which is overseen by leaders of several progressive organizations, tested voter agreement with various descriptions of the economy. It found that progressive messages scored best when they were phrased around disparities in how the economy was performing for the very rich compared with everyone else. For example: \"The gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else has never been bigger -- we need big, bold changes in Washington to unrig the economic system so working people can get ahead.\"Democratic arguments are resonating with some voters. Rafael Corrales, 24, recently moved back home to Omaha, in part because rents in Seattle, where he had been living, climbed too high. An independent voter and the first member of his family to graduate from college, Mr. Corrales is now looking for work.His parents, a construction worker and a teacher's aide, have not seen a raise in years. Health insurance premiums keep going up. His friends are drowning in student debt.\"Many of my friends have thousands of dollars in loans, and they still don't have a job in their field and they're working in a grocery store,\" he said. \"Maybe for people who do have money in the stock market or have higher earnings, it has improved. But for the average American, I don't think it has improved at all.\"About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 2,969 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Jan. 6 to 12. The company selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.PhotographSamuel Knight said the economy might make him vote for President Trump.

Bolton that bolsters the impeachment case against the president. But by day's end, Republican leaders working feverishly to block testimony from Mr. Bolton or other witnesses indicated they had not yet corralled the votes to do so.On the final day of arguments on Mr. Trump's behalf, Jay Sekulow, one of the president's private lawyers, sought to raise doubts about Mr. Bolton's claim in an unpublished manuscript that Mr. Trump tied the release of military aid to Ukraine to investigations into his political rivals, calling it an \"unsourced allegation\" that was \"inadmissible\" in his impeachment trial.Just after Mr. Trump's team ended a three-day legal defense, Republican senators rushed into a private meeting room in the Capitol, where Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, worked to herd his rank and file in line behind ending the trial without witnesses.He carried a card that bore a tally of Republican votes on the question, and warned that he did not yet have enough to block an expected Democratic move to call witnesses because some Republicans remained uncommitted, according to people familiar with the meeting who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.\"It was a serious family discussion,\" Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, told reporters as he emerged from the senators-only meeting in the Strom Thurmond Room. \"Some people are sincerely exploring all the avenues.\"But behind the scenes, key Republicans said they were increasingly confident they could bring the trial to an end, and they described Mr. McConnell's comments as a pointed signal that it was time for rank-and-file senators to fall in line.The talks unfolded after Mr. Trump's team essentially rested its case against removing him from office, ending oral arguments by urging senators to ignore what Mr. Bolton might have to say. Without directly denying the veracity of his account, whose existence was first reported by The New York Times, Mr. Sekulow argued that the behavior Mr. Bolton described had no place in the discussion of the president's fate.Impeachment \"is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts,\" Mr. Sekulow said. \"That is politics, unfortunately. Hamilton put impeachment in the hands of this body, the Senate, precisely and specifically to be above that fray.\"The argument was a bid to quiet the anger and anxiety that Mr. Bolton's revelation prompted in Republican ranks when it emerged on Sunday at a critical stage in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial. Conservatives said the case for moving directly to acquittal without new testimony or documents was overwhelming, but key moderates, including Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said they were still undecided.Two Republicans, Senators Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, have said they would most likely vote for witnesses, but Democrats would need four Republicans to join them in order to prevail. Another moderate, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, indicated earlier in the day that \"Mr. Bolton probably has some things that would be helpful for us.\"Inside the private meeting on Tuesday, Mr. McConnell and his allies warned that allowing witnesses would blow the trial wide open and potentially prolong it by weeks. Clutching his whip count of yeses, noes and maybes, Mr. McConnell appeared to be suggesting that undecided senators needed to make up their minds and join the majority of their colleagues in opposing witnesses.The activity inside and outside the Senate chamber underscored how Mr. Bolton's account has threatened to upend the trial, injecting an element of unpredictability into a proceeding that had appeared headed for Mr. Trump's acquittal by week's end.The longtime Republican foreign policy figure has made clear that he would testify if called, but senators also know that regardless of his account, there is almost no chance that the Republican-controlled chamber would vote to convict Mr. Trump and remove him from office less than 10 months before a presidential election. A 67-vote supermajority would be needed to do so.How they proceed now could have significant political ramifications not just for Mr. Trump, but also for Republican senators up for re-election in swing states this fall who want to show voters that they conducted a fair trial.Democrats prepared to accuse Republicans of a cover-up if they do not vote for witnesses pounced on Mr. Sekulow's remarks about Mr. Bolton, saying that his reference to \"unsourced allegations\" proved their point that the Senate must subpoena him to clarify his precise account.\"Once again, the president's team, in a way that only they could, have further made the case for calling John Bolton,\" Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead House manager, told reporters during a break in the proceedings.Proponents of calling Mr. Bolton also got an unexpected bit of support late Monday from John F. Kelly, the former White House chief of staff, who told an audience in Florida that he believed Mr. Bolton's account and supported the Senate seeking direct witnesses.\"I think some of the conversations seem to me to be very inappropriate, but I wasn't there,\" he said, according to The Sarasota Herald-Tribune. \"But there are people that were there that ought to be heard from.\"Republican leaders appeared to be slowing down what had been a breakneck trial schedule to allow for fuller consideration of the matter. They were hopeful that by putting distance between the emergence of Mr. Bolton's account and the vote on witnesses, tensions would cool enough to hold a majority intact.\"We're trying to get everyone on the same page,\" said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas.Beginning Wednesday, senators will have up to 16 hours over two days to question the prosecution and defense teams. Much of that time will probably be used to allow the two sides to respond to each other's arguments, but Democrats and Republicans were also preparing pointed questions intended to highlight soft spots in the respective cases.At the White House, Mr. Trump was uncharacteristically quiet about the proceedings, which he has followed on television in recent days. He sought to put his policy agenda on full display, unveiling a long-awaited Middle East peace plan.But as he traveled back from a political rally in New Jersey on Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump provided encouragement for the Republican leaders' fighting to bypass witnesses.\"No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats, no matter how much information is given, like the quickly produced Transcripts, it will NEVER be enough for them,\" he wrote on Twitter. \"They will always scream UNFAIR.\"Inside the Senate chamber, Mr. Sekulow and two White House lawyers delivered a voluble and indignant final defense, capping three days of oral arguments on the president's behalf against the House's abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges.On Saturday, they began by accusing Democrats of conducting a witch hunt with a predetermined outcome: removing Mr. Trump not only from office but from the 2020 presidential ballot. They told senators that the House managers had cherry-picked the facts they liked and hid others that were more flattering to the president. And they directly contradicted Democrats' reading of a July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukraine's president, asserting that Mr. Trump had acted well within his rights as chief executive.On Monday, the lawyers took aim at former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, resurfacing unsubstantiated accusations of corruption to contend that Mr. Trump had been acting reasonably when he asked Ukraine to investigate the pair. They played down the role of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer at the center of the Ukraine pressure campaign, calling him a \"colorful distraction\" Democrats used to obscure a weak case against Mr. Trump. And they trotted out two legal celebrities, Ken Starr and Alan M. Dershowitz, to make the case that the House's charges did not rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.Many Republicans moved quickly on Tuesday to adopt Mr. Dershowitz's arguments that abuse of power and obstruction of Congress were not impeachable offenses. The argument cut against the legal consensus, and against Mr. Dershowitz's own earlier views, that impeachable offenses need not be crimes.\"I listened to Ken Starr and Dershowitz loud and clear yesterday,\" said Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina. \"The whole premise of the impeachment, I think, is false. I don't think we need witnesses.\"Punctuating his remarks on Tuesday with a refrain of \"danger, danger, danger,\" Mr. Sekulow insisted that the managers' case was built solely on a policy dispute with the president over his push to combat corruption in Ukraine.\"If that becomes the new normal, future presidents, Democrats and Republicans, will be paralyzed the moment they are elected, even before they can take the oath of office,\" Mr. Sekulow said. \"The bar for impeachment cannot be set this low.\"Despite his warnings, Mr. Sekulow did not directly deny Mr. Bolton's account, instead reading aloud from statements by Mr. Trump, the Justice Department and the vice president's office contesting it.Democrats spent three days last week arguing just the opposite. They said that the House's two-month investigation concluded that Mr. Trump had used the powers of his office not in the pursuit of a policy objective but for his own political advantage. When he was caught, they argued, he sought to conceal what he had done by ordering an across the board defiance of their investigationClocking in at under an hour and a half, the bare-bones closing argument from Mr. Trump's lawyers underscored their confidence in the final outcome. In the end, they used less than half of the 24 hours available to them to present a case to senators.Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, ended Tuesday's presentation by playing a highlight reel of House and Senate Democrats arguing against a partisan impeachment in 1998, including Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, one of the House managers, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.\"You were right,\" Mr. Cipollone said, looking directly at Mr. Schumer.\"All you need in this case are the Constitution and your common sense,\" Mr. Cipollone sad. \"The articles of impeachment fall far short of any constitutional standard, and they are dangerous.\"Reporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Emily Cochrane and Catie Edmondson.Reporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Emily Cochrane and Catie Edmondson.PhotographThe defense lawyers Pat Cipollone, left, and Jay Sekulow.

But, he said, the company should avoid hurting Mr. Trump's campaign.SAN FRANCISCO -- Since the 2016 election, when Russian trolls and a tsunami of misinformation turned social media into a partisan battlefield, Facebook has wrestled with the role it played in President Trump's victory.Now, according to a memo obtained by The New York Times, a longtime Facebook executive has told employees that the company had a moral duty not to tilt the scales against Mr. Trump as he seeks re-election.On Dec. 30, Andrew Bosworth, the head of Facebook's virtual and augmented reality division, wrote on his internal Facebook page that, as a liberal, he found himself wanting to use the social network's powerful platform against Mr. Trump. But citing the \"Lord of the Rings\" franchise and the philosopher John Rawls, Mr. Bosworth said that doing so would eventually backfire.\"I find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result,\" he wrote. \"So what stays my hand? I find myself thinking of the Lord of the Rings at this moment.\"Specifically when Frodo offers the ring to Galadrial and she imagines using the power righteously, at first, but knows it will eventually corrupt her,\" he said, misspelling the name of the character Galadriel. \"As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear.\"In a meandering 2,500-word post, titled \"Thoughts for 2020,\" Mr. Bosworth weighed in on issues including political polarization, Russian interference and the news media's treatment of Facebook. He gave a frank assessment of Facebook's shortcomings in recent years, saying that the company had been \"late\" to address the issues of data security, misinformation and foreign interference. And he accused the left of overreach, saying that when it came to calling people Nazis, \"I think my fellow liberals are a bit too, well, liberal.\"Mr. Bosworth also waded into the debate over the health effects of social media, rejecting what he called \"wildly offensive\" comparisons of Facebook to addictive substances like nicotine. He instead compared Facebook to sugar, and said users were responsible for moderating their own intake.\"If I want to eat sugar and die an early death that is a valid position,\" Mr. Bosworth wrote. \"My grandfather took such a stance towards bacon and I admired him for it. And social media is likely much less fatal than bacon.\"The post by Mr. Bosworth, a former head of Facebook's advertising team, provides an unusually candid glimpse of the debates raging within Facebook about the platform's responsibilities as it heads into the 2020 election.The biggest of those debates is whether Facebook should change its rules governing political speech. Posts by politicians are exempt from many of Facebook's current rules, and their ads are not submitted for fact-checking, giving them license to mislead voters with partisan misinformation.Last year, platforms like Twitter and Google announced restrictions to their political advertising tools ahead of the 2020 election.Facebook and its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, have faced heavy pressure from Democrats and Republicans, including Mr. Trump's campaign, not to restrict its own powerful ad platform, which allows political campaigns to reach targeted audiences and raise money from supporters. But other politicians, and some Facebook employees, including a group that petitioned Mr. Zuckerberg in October, have argued that the social network has a responsibility to stamp out misinformation on its platform, including in posts by politicians.Mr. Bosworth said that even though keeping the current policies in place \"very well may lead to\" Mr. Trump's re-election, it was the right decision.Dozens of Facebook employees pushed back on Mr. Bosworth's conclusions, arguing in the comments section below his post that politicians should be held to the same standard as other Facebook users. They debated whether Facebook should ban or remove posts by politicians, including Mr. Trump, that included hate speech or forms of misinformation.One Facebook employee warned that if the company continued to take its current approach, it risked promoting populist leaders around the world, including in the United States.A Facebook spokeswoman provided a statement from Mr. Bosworth in which he said that the post \"wasn't written for public consumption,\" but that he \"hoped this post would encourage my co-workers to continue to accept criticism with grace as we accept the responsibility we have overseeing our platform.\"Ultimately, the decision on whether to allow politicians to spread misinformation on Facebook rests with Mr. Zuckerberg. In recent months, he has appeared to stand firm on the decision to keep the existing ad policies in place, saying that he believes Facebook should not become an arbiter of truth. But he has also left himself room to change his mind. In November, a Facebook spokesman said the company was \"looking at different ways we might refine our approach to political ads.\"Among those lobbying Mr. Zuckerberg is President Trump himself, who claimed on a radio show on Monday that Mr. Zuckerberg had congratulated him on being \"No. 1\" on Facebook during a private dinner.Mr. Bosworth said he believed Facebook was responsible for Mr. Trump's 2016 election victory, but not because of Russian interference or the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which millions of Facebook users' data was leaked to a political strategy firm that worked with the Trump campaign. Mr. Bosworth said the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica revelations -- uncovered by The Times, working with The Observer of London and The Guardian -- rightly changed the conversation around how Facebook should handle user data, and which companies should be given access to that data.But, he said, Mr. Trump simply used Facebook's advertising tools effectively.\"He didn't get elected because of Russia or misinformation or Cambridge Analytica,\" Mr. Bosworth wrote. \"He got elected because he ran the single best digital ad campaign I've ever seen from any advertiser. Period.\"Mr. Bosworth, a longtime confidant of Mr. Zuckerberg's who is viewed by some inside Facebook as a proxy for the chief executive, has been an outspoken defender of the company's positions in the past.In 2018, BuzzFeed News published a memo Mr. Bosworth wrote in 2016 justifying the company's growth-at-all-costs ethos, in which he said the company's mission of connecting people was \"de facto good,\" even if it resulted in deaths.After the memo's publication, a Facebook executive said the company wished it could \"go back and hit delete\" on Mr. Bosworth's 2016 post.PhotographAn internal memo by Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, warned employees not to tilt the scales against President Trump's re-election bid.

And through it all, President Trump sniped from the sidelines, demonizing the party and its 2020 contenders as socialists.Almost overnight, everything has changed. Amid deepening uncertainty over a spreading virus and growing anxiety about an economic meltdown, that kind of classic presidential campaign ended and something extraordinary has begun: a real-time, life-or-death test of competency and leadership for those seeking the White House this November.Over 18 hours from Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon, the three major candidates for the presidency, including the incumbent, made quick pivots to shape and guide the country's new political discourse. It was an attempt to demonstrate how they would lead Americans across a muddled terrain of social disruption and stock market collapse, of worry about testing kits and concern about travel bans and crowd sizes.Just hours after Mr. Trump delivered a wooden address from the Oval Office, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sought to position himself as a sober steward of the national interest, delivering a speech echoing the language and tone of addresses given by presidents in moments of crisis. Mr. Biden also went much further than Mr. Trump in proposing a detailed plan and a set of goals on testing, increasing hospital capacity and supporting an accelerated push for a vaccine.\"This virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,\" Mr. Biden said, standing in front of a backdrop of American flags. \"Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by adversarial relationships with the truth that he continues to have.\"With his sharp criticisms of Mr. Trump's shifting statements about the crisis, and the administration's inability to stem the falling stock market, Mr. Biden was also taking direct aim at Mr. Trump's oft-heard arguments for re-election in November.The spread of the virus is rapidly becoming a test of Mr. Trump's core message: that despite the controversy the president creates, Americans are better off economically than before he took office and should stick with him, rather than siding with Democrats whom Mr. Trump portrays as feckless half-wits who botched the Iowa caucuses and much more.Now it is Mr. Trump who risks looking out of his depth to many Americans, not only in protecting their health but also in guarding their 401(k)s.Two hours after Mr. Biden spoke, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- the other leading candidate for the Democratic nomination -- warned that the death toll of Americans from the coronavirus could exceed the number of U.S. soldiers killed during World War II.\"We have an administration that is largely incompetent and whose incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people in this country,\" Mr. Sanders said.The setting of the speeches underscored the unusual situation the campaigns now face. Normally at this time candidates would be traveling the country, rallying supporters at town hall meetings, fund-raisers and mass rallies. But both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have curtailed their travel and canceled big gatherings because of the virus, and on Thursday they found themselves addressing small groups of reporters in sparse hotel ballrooms in their hometowns, Wilmington, Del., and Burlington, Vt.Political strategists compared the virus to a hurricane, a deeply disruptive event likely to affect broad swaths of the country in unpredictable and devastating ways. The response to those moments can make or break a political career, they say.\"You don't blame the elected officials for causing the damage that the hurricane ravages across the state,\" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster with experience on presidential and Senate campaigns. \"You evaluate elected officials on how they handle the situation.\"Even as the fate of the country's health remains uncertain, the dynamics of the primary race are clarifying. After a series of primary wins, Mr. Biden now has a delegate lead that would require a nearly impossible turnaround from Mr. Sanders to overcome.That leaves Mr. Trump likely to face an opponent whom he spent much of 2019 trying to destroy. Yet, in a moment of crisis, some Democrats argue that the country may turn to a creature of the Washington establishment, seeing Mr. Biden as an experienced hand.\"A lot of people, not just Democrats, are going to start looking to Mr. Biden and sizing him up. It's a real-time test at some level,\" said Addisu Demissie, who managed the presidential campaign of Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. \"Even though he doesn't have authority, he can show and not tell what four years of a Biden presidency would feel like.\"In particular, Democrats believe the virus will help them hold more moderate, independent suburban voters who don't like the president's tone but have stayed with him because of the strong economy. The party won control of the House in 2018 largely on the strength of their support among those voters, flipping a number of seats in battleground districts. Exit polling from Tuesday's primaries showed that a majority of voters saw Mr. Biden as the candidate they trusted most to handle a major crisis.For rural voters, who are more likely to vote for Republicans, the economic ramifications could affect their bottom lines, particularly farmers and oil workers who are already hurting from trade policies.Yet, the fiercely partisan moment in Washington has scrambled the politics of unity that traditionally kick into place during times of national crisis. The partisan divide is so pervasive that it has affected not only people's feelings about the president's response, but also their fears about the virus itself.Roughly six in 10 Republican voters nationwide said they were not particularly concerned that the coronavirus would disrupt their lives, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week. Democratic voters were twice as likely as Republicans to say they are concerned.While privately concerned about the impact on the president's re-election prospects, Republicans are largely following Mr. Trump's lead in minimizing the worries over the coronavirus and blaming Democrats and the media for focusing on the deaths it has caused.\"One thing the press has not covered at all is the people who have really recovered,\" said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican ally of Mr. Trump's. \"Right now all people are hearing about are the deaths. I'm sure the deaths are horrific, but the flip side of this is the vast majority of people who get coronavirus do survive.\"In recent days, Mr. Trump and his administration have taken a more active hand in the public messaging around the response. But senior public health officials have frequently contradicted or corrected statements made by the president; in the late hours of Wednesday evening various administration officials corrected four separate policies that Mr. Trump had announced during his nationally televised address.On Thursday morning, after news broke that an aide to the Brazilian president had tested positive for the coronavirus days after being in proximity to Mr. Trump at his South Florida hotel, Mr. Trump said he was not worried. The White House later said he had not been tested for the virus himself.\"Let's put it this way,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I'm not concerned.\"As the election year progresses into unknown territory, the candidates must now find ways to motivate voters from a distance. A number of Mr. Biden's donors and supporters were quietly nervous about the effect that the coronavirus could have on events large and small in coming weeks, saying it had injected a fresh measure of uncertainty into the race.Scheduled Biden campaign events in Chicago and Miami are being transformed into \"virtual events\" ahead of next Tuesday's primaries in Arizona, Illinois, Florida and Ohio. On Thursday, both the Biden and Sanders campaigns instructed staff members to begin working from home.Mr. Trump appears to be stopping all campaign-related events indefinitely, which would remove a major political weapon from his arsenal as he moves into the general election campaign.Beyond the rallies, the virus throws into question nearly every mechanism of modern campaigning. Already, officials in Arizona, Ohio and Illinois are scrambling to move polling places out of nursing homes -- with early voting already well underway.On Thursday, the Democratic National Committee announced it would move Sunday's presidential debate to Washington from Phoenix to minimize travel. At least nine members of Congress have self-quarantined after exposure to the virus, including several who had interactions with the president. Across the country, political events are being canceled, including some state party conventions where the delegates who vote on the nominee are elected.Democratic activists are exploring ways to expand their virtual organizing efforts through Facebook and text. Abortion rights activists are planning a \"virtual call center\" on Sunday to support a Democrat challenging an incumbent in the Chicago suburbs. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin on Thursday canceled all in-person voter canvassing ahead of the state's April 7 elections.\"As a campaign, it is completely against every instinct you have: no fund-raising and no big events,\" said David Pepper, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. \"In the final week of a primary that's the opposite of everything you'd want to do.\"Yet the questions go well beyond mass events and voting and will only get more challenging the longer the virus continues to disrupt social contact. What's a baby-kissing politician supposed to do when he cannot kiss a baby? How do you gather staff members in a war room, if they can't be in the same room? Can volunteers go knocking on doors in affected areas? If the campaign moves even more online, can officials protect against a heightened threat of election interference and disinformation?It's not known how long the coronavirus and its aftereffects will affect the election or be paramount on voters' minds.\"There's a long time until the election,\" said Corry Bliss, who ran the House Republicans' super PAC in 2018. \"Last month, the world was convinced the only thing that would matter in 2020 was impeachment.\"Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting from New York.PhotographJoseph R.

And a flurry of Bloomberg attack ads is angering the president.WASHINGTON -- A few days after Election Day in 2016, Donald J. Trump received a call on his cellphone from Michael R. Bloomberg, an old acquaintance he had clashed with during the campaign.Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, had called to offer his congratulations, but the president-elect cut him off.\"You were very mean to me!\" Mr. Trump said, according to people familiar with the call. Mr. Trump was referring to Mr. Bloomberg's slashing speech that year at the Democratic National Convention, during which he called the Republican a \"con\" and called on voters to elect a \"sane, competent person.\"Mr. Trump settled down almost immediately, then turned the conversation toward his latest predicament: quickly hiring people to fill out his government.Mr. Bloomberg, according to the people briefed on the call, told him that when he was first elected mayor in 2001, he, too, had never served in government. What Mr. Trump should do, Mr. Bloomberg advised, was to \"hire a lot of people smarter than you.\"\"Mike,\" Mr. Trump replied tersely, \"there is no one smarter than me.\" A startled Mr. Bloomberg paused before turning the conversation to a less fraught subject: golf.The 10-minute phone conversation was the last time the two men spoke.Mr. Bloomberg is now pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into an effort to become the Democratic presidential nominee, an unprecedented self-financed campaign that the party's top-polling candidates have mostly ignored. But much of Mr. Bloomberg's spending does not promote his own campaign at all, and instead attacks Mr. Trump on issues like health care and integrity in the military -- a blitz of negative television ads that has managed to anger the president.Mr. Bloomberg has taunted Mr. Trump in other ways. He bought a Google search ad criticizing Mr. Trump that appeared prominently when users searched for the word \"impeachment.\"Though aides have implored him not to take the bait, Mr. Trump has been unable to resist. He has branded Mr. Bloomberg, who is 5 feet 7 inches tall, as \"Mini Mike\" on Twitter, and sparred with him over health care. He has also told aides that Mr. Bloomberg is a \"bad guy.\"When it was disclosed that Mr. Bloomberg had bought a Super Bowl ad for about $10 million, for instance, the president's re-election campaign, within hours, said that it had also bought a $10 million ad to be aired during the game.As members of Manhattan's wealthy elite for decades, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump, while never friends, sometimes crossed paths at a charity golf game or a fund-raiser. Over the years they have boosted each other when it served to boost themselves.Mr. Trump often praised Mr. Bloomberg's leadership of New York City. And Mr. Bloomberg gave him an implicit stamp of approval when he twice appeared on Mr. Trump's reality TV show, \"The Apprentice,\" and when his administration awarded Mr. Trump a city contract to refurbish a golf course.In 2008, Mr. Bloomberg joined Mr. Trump, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Joe Torre, the former Yankees manager, for an event at Mr. Trump's golf course in Westchester County, N.Y., where they were photographed grinning together in matching tightly fitted caps.Both men now play down any moments of bonhomie from their past.Like Mr. Trump before him, Mr. Bloomberg had flirted with running for president for so long, it had become something of a political punch line until he actually jumped into the race in November.As Mr. Bloomberg weighed a presidential run last winter, some Trump advisers thought he would make a useful target for Mr. Trump, always in need of a foil, because of his history of trying to ban sugary drinks in New York City and his advocacy against guns. But on an intuitive level, Mr. Trump is keenly aware of how things play on television and the potency of running as a change agent. Frustrated, he has recently told associates that Mr. Bloomberg is \"trying to buy the election,\" and noted that even he himself took donations in his 2016 campaign.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Bloomberg's transactionalism -- and interest in winning whatever contest he is part of -- also has echoes of Mr. Trump's approach.Both men built up their fortunes in the 1980s in New York -- one a self-made billionaire who spent his money lavishly, the other born into privilege and often described as frugal -- slapping their names on their companies and their products. Mr. Trump, a garrulous entertainer, was a contrast with Mr. Bloomberg, a dry-humored businessman whose Massachusetts accent has never totally faded.By the time Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002, Mr. Trump was not a builder in New York City so much as an entertainer, a brander and a licenser, and so had less business to conduct with Mr. Bloomberg than with two of the previous mayors, Mr. Giuliani and Ed Koch. Mr. Trump had a famously cantankerous relationship with Mr. Koch, but needed support from him and from Mr. Giuliani for his development projects.Mr. Trump, after backing Democrats when Mr. Bloomberg was running for mayor as a Republican in 2001, became a full-throated supporter of the new mayor, as their daughters Ivanka Trump and Georgina Bloomberg appeared in a documentary about children of privilege, lamenting the complexity of their lives.\"We are friends, we were before her father was elected and it's not going to change after,\" Ms. Bloomberg wrote in an email in 2018, before her father made his presidential ambitions official. \"I'm not a fan of him or his politics, but you don't stop being friends with someone because of the actions of a family member.\"When Mr. Bloomberg began looking at a way to undo the city's two-term limit so he could run again, a move that was successful but that infuriated a number of New Yorkers and some elected officials, Mr. Trump defended the idea.Term limits are \"a terrible idea, an artificial barrier,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Why is he being told he cannot run again?\"Mr. Bloomberg twice appeared on \"The Apprentice,\" an opportunity aides said helped him boost the city's \"Made in NY\" tax credit initiative. In one episode, Mr. Bloomberg judged a hot dog competition.\"As the No. 1 frank-ophile in the city, I'm supposed to see if you can cut the mustard,\" Mr. Bloomberg told an all-female team on the episode, in 2004. \"I can't tell whether these are better or worse than the one the men are selling until I have a hot dog with the men. But I can tell you without seeing the men -- you look better.\"In 2011, the Bloomberg administration awarded a contract to the Trump Organization to operate and manage a Bronx golf course that had been a boondoggle for decades. The city had completed almost all of the construction, with growing the grass and building a clubhouse and concession stands left to Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has described the project as one that he saved, similar to his work on the city's Wollman Rink in the 1980s. In a 2015 blog post, Ms. Trump wrote about how her father had arrived on the site of the golf course and ended 20 years of mismanagement. That description rankled former Bloomberg officials, who called it exaggerated.During the Bloomberg mayoral years, Mr. Trump became more socially conservative, as Mr. Bloomberg became more socially liberal. Mr. Bloomberg embraced the movement for stricter gun regulation, an effort for which Mr. Trump -- now tightly aligned with the National Rifle Association -- once praised him for even though he didn't support the policy. He said the mayor was \"putting his money where his mouth is.\"Mr. Trump would often say that the Bloomberg mayoralty had been \"good for me,\" recalled Sam Nunberg, a former aide to Mr. Trump.But Mr. Trump has given conflicting assessments of Mr. Bloomberg's prospects as a presidential contender. When Mr. Bloomberg was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate shortly after he left office at the end of 2013, Mr. Trump's advisers told him he would never gain traction.\"He's a political basket case -- you don't know if he's a Republican, you don't know if he's a Democrat, he's all over the place,\" Mr. Nunberg said at that time.But in that same year Mr. Trump praised Mr. Bloomberg, noting he had done a \"very good job\" as mayor and mused in a Fox News interview that Mr. Bloomberg was probably interested in higher office. He is \"going to be out there very strongly in some form,\" Mr. Trump said.By early 2016, Mr. Bloomberg had ruled out a campaign of his own as an independent, in part because he said he feared helping elect Mr. Trump, whose candidacy he had described with growing alarm as he watched from the sidelines.When he endorsed Hillary Clinton, her aides thought his backing would resonate with independent and persuadable Republican voters, and asked him to make that pitch at the Democratic National Convention.\"Bloomberg was someone who had a long history with Trump, who could speak as a fellow billionaire and fellow New Yorker to what and who the real Donald Trump was,\" said Jim Margolis, a former aide to Ms. Clinton who helped organize the convention.That speech resonated with Mr. Trump as well.\"'Little' Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me,\" Mr. Trump said on Twitter soon after the speech. \"His last term as Mayor was a disaster!\"PhotographMichael R. Bloomberg and Donald J. Trump sometimes crossed paths at charity golf tournaments. Here they are at an event in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., in 2007.

Parts of the industry are suffering immediate hits from the coronavirus outbreak, such as corn growers who have seen prices for ethanol plummet and mom-and-pop suppliers of farm markets that have closed in many cities.But unlike industries such as airlines, hotels and automakers, which have largely or completely shut down, most farms are still operating. And sales of some products in the industry have surged as worried consumers stock up, generating shortages of meat, chicken, eggs and flour.The law provides Mr. Perdue with $9.5 billion to support farmers, including livestock producers, suppliers of farm markets and producers of specialty crops, and $14 billion in borrowing authority to replenish the fund he used to make trade-related payments to farmers in the past two years. The department's entire discretionary budget request for next year is about $23 billion.The Agriculture Department will also receive an additional $25.1 billion for food aid programs for poor families from the stimulus bill.\"We are effectively subsiding every other sector of the economy\" in the $2 trillion stimulus package, said Joshua Sewell, a farming industry analyst at Taxpayers for Common Sense, which advocates less government spending. \"So I guess the argument goes that agriculture wants its piece of the pie, too.\"The administration's use of the money will become a major political factor in rural America in the middle of an election year in which Midwestern states could be pivotal, said Lawrence R. Jacobs, the director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at University of Minnesota. He predicted that Mr. Trump would soon be trumpeting it as part of his re-election campaign.\"This is just an extraordinary and unprecedented opportunity in the modern era for a president to dole out cash,\" he said. \"In urban areas, they call this walking around money, which a politician hands out to secure support.\"A small army of groups mounted the fast-moving campaign for aid, including the politically powerful American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. Joining them were other smaller players representing producers of goods like turkey, pork and potatoes or sunflowers, sorghum, peanuts and eggs.Among their targets were farm-state lawmakers like Senators John Hoeven of North Dakota, who pressed for $50 billion in aid for agriculture. Others included Senators Pat Roberts of Kansas, John Thune of South Dakota and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. All are Republicans who serve on the Senate agriculture committee or the appropriations subcommittee that oversees farm aid.Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the agriculture committee, was also lobbied.\"We want to make sure that farmers, ranchers and rural Americans are also recognized as needing assistance,\" said Dale Moore, the executive vice president of the American Farm Bureau and a former chief of staff at the Agriculture Department.Farmers in Midwestern states like Iowa, Illinois and Minnesota -- as well as in Texas and Kansas -- reaped much of the $26 billion spent in the past two years to blunt the economic effect of the administration's trade policies, according to Joseph W. Glauber of the International Food Policy Research Institute.Without those payments, net farm income last year would have dropped about 5 percent, he estimated. Instead, it rose nearly 12 percent.Seth Meyer, an agricultural economist with the University of Missouri, said the economic blow to agriculture from the virus could be harder to offset than the lost sales from trade policy.\"If you are producing flowers and there is no wedding this summer, if you were a fruit and vegetable grower selling through a restaurant wholesaler, what do you do now?\" he asked. \"What if you are a milk producer selling your product to a processor who has trouble organizing transportation and labor?\"The bottom line, he said, could be a bigger effect on farmers than that created by the trade friction with China -- \"much bigger, potentially.\"Still, some parts of the industry are seeing benefits from the pandemic. Some big meat producers, including Tyson Foods, announced special bonuses this week for farmers to reward them for the increase in work to keep supermarket shelves stocked.In general, farmers have weathered recessions better than other economic groups, because while consumers cut purchases of goods like clothing and change their eating habits to save money, they always need food. This downturn is fundamentally different from others in many ways, but Wall Street analysts are issuing bullish predictions for parts of the agriculture industry based on the surge in demand for products like beef and chicken.\"Meat is flying off the shelves\" wrote Ken Goldman, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, who upgraded the stocks of Tyson and Sanderson Farms, two major chicken and meat producers. \"We now believe that outstanding retail demand for meat is more than offsetting soft demand at food service.\"Prices being paid to farmers raising cattle and other animals have dropped in recent weeks, reflecting declines in financial markets worldwide and disruptions in supply chains, although these prices recovered somewhat this week.Major meatpackers are drawing scrutiny as demand rises, amid some suspicion that they are gaming the system to push up their own profits at the expense of farmers and consumers.\"If packers are illegally manipulating markets during crisis we need USDA & DOJ & CFTC to investigate + help farmers,\" Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, wrote on Twitter on Friday, referring to the Department of Justice and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates markets where these goods are bought and sold.Congress imposed almost no limit on how Mr. Perdue spends the money, suggesting only that the $9.5 billion chunk be used to support a wide range of agricultural producers. The legislation set aside $750,000 for the agency's inspector general for \"conducting audits and investigations of projects and activities carried out with funds.\"Similarly, with the $14 billion for the Commodity Credit Corporation, there is very little guidance on how that money can be spent other than it be used for an \"emergency requirement.\"With the streets empty, cars parked and demand for fuel depressed, corn growers are among the most likely recipients. Mr. Meyer of the University of Missouri said about 40 percent of corn production goes into the ethanol industry, where \"you are starting to hear of people shutting down.\"Historically, the Commodity Credit Corporation only made payments to wheat, corn, soybean and livestock farmers during unexpected drops in crop prices because of surpluses or declines in output related to weather or disease.But the administration has used this program to reimburse farmers for billions in dollars in losses after China stopped buying soybeans and other crops to punish the United States for tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Chinese products.Mr. Perdue has repeatedly warned farmers not to count on continuing to receive payments from that federal program. But every time funding has been about to run out, Mr. Trump has clamored to spend more.In late February, after the administration reached a new trade agreement with China, for instance, Mr. Perdue said, \"I am not advising any farmer to expect any market program at this point, as the market should adjust for the current trade expectations.\"The very next day, Mr. Trump tweeted that if farmers needed more aid while waiting for the terms of new trade deals to kick in, \"that aid will be provided by the federal government.\"Although the Agriculture Department is not obligated to use its new spending authority, industry analysts fully expect it will, especially with Election Day a little over seven months away.Brent Gloy, a corn, wheat and soybean farmer and agricultural economist from Nebraska, said, \"Those checks are going to go out.\"Kitty Bennett contributed research.Kitty Bennett contributed research.PhotographAs much as $23.5 billion is set aside for farmers, who could be a key for President Trump's re-election bid.

Ms. Collins, one of a handful of moderate Republicans whose votes could alter the trajectory of the trial, said she does not regret her votes to acquit then.She said she would use the same logic behind that decision when she weighs the impeachment charges against President Trump in a Senate trial that begins in earnest next week.\"I, too, was furious at President Clinton and felt that he had lied under oath, but it didn't reach the constitutional test of high crimes and misdemeanors, and was not sufficient to overturn an election and throw him out of office,\" she said in an interview on Thursday in her Capitol Hill office.In the case of Mr. Trump, she said, she would be \"applying that same standard.\"Ms. Collins's position as a centrist gives her outsize influence over the shape of Mr. Trump's trial, including whether new witnesses and evidence will be heard, just as it has in some of the most important and impassioned debates during her four terms in the Senate. But that middle ground is shrinking in the Trump era, leaving her open to bitter attack from both political parties.She was among three Republicans who sank Mr. Trump's attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and she helped lead an unsuccessful effort to prevent him from taking unallocated money for his border wall. But she also voted for a tax bill that was the centerpiece of the Republican agenda. And the move that overshadowed all that was her deciding vote to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault.Ms. Collins's health care vote in 2017 fueled hopes on the left and anger on the right over whether she might stray from party orthodoxy. But the Kavanaugh vote and the tax vote reinforced her lifelong party affiliation despite her aversion to parts of Mr. Trump's agenda.That confirmation vote -- and her impassioned speech defending it on the Senate floor -- generated millions of dollars in donations to be used against her, and a lengthy period of harassment and intimidation by critics, including numerous death threats. There were so many hostile calls targeting her that a 25-year-old employee in one of her Maine offices quit. One day, her husband texted Ms. Collins a photo of himself in a hazmat suit; someone had sent a threatening letter to their Maine home -- where protesters gathered eight Sundays in a row -- that claimed to contain ricin.In Washington, a man waited for Ms. Collins in the dark as she parked her car one evening in the pouring rain, then followed her several blocks to her townhouse. A neighbor lamented to her that he hated living next to \"a rape apologist.\"\"It just made the whole time very unpleasant,\" said Ms. Collins, who faces a steep re-election challenge in November, when she will seek a fifth term. \"But anyone who thinks that they can intimidate me doesn't know me.\"Ms. Collins's history, and her competitive race to keep her seat, puts her at the top of the list of senators under scrutiny in the impeachment debate. Reporters on Capitol Hill toil to divine her intentions; as the articles of impeachment were read Thursday on the Senate floor, Ms. Collins, who was suffering a bad cold, coughed and dabbed at her eyes, causing several reporters to call her office to ask why she was crying.Her vote at the conclusion of Mr. Trump's trial almost certainly will not determine whether he becomes the first president to be removed from office by the Senate -- the 67 votes required, at this point, are not there. But Ms. Collins will be pivotal to resolving procedural questions, including a battle between Republicans and Democrats over calling witnesses and admitting new documents as part of the Senate trial. And Ms. Collins has signaled that she will buck her party and support both moves.\"I would anticipate that it is likely that I would vote to have more information brought forward, whether witnesses or documents or both,\" she said Thursday.Ms. Collins convened several meetings in her office with the Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee to cobble together a provision ensuring a vote on the matter after opening arguments by both sides and questions from senators. If the four hang together on the issue, their votes would be enough -- along with the 47 that Democrats control -- to demand more information come out in the trial.And her eventual vote on whether to remove the president will be politically significant as well, both to Mr. Trump and to Ms. Collins. Since he was impeached last month, the president has leaned on his party's unified opposition to dismiss the whole effort as a partisan \"hoax,\" and he has made it clear he looks forward to an exoneration by the Republican-led chamber. Even a single Republican vote in favor of removing him would undermine that.In Maine, Ms. Collins's choice could prove even more consequential to voters, and perhaps play a critical role in her legacy.\"There is no doubt that there are going to be Mainers unhappy with me no matter what conclusion I reach,\" said Ms. Collins, who said she has been powering through an enormous white binder detailing the trial's substance.The Kavanaugh confirmation, among the most bitter Senate fights of the Trump administration, may have shored up support among a Republican base smarting from some of Ms. Collins's other votes, but it enraged many of the independent and Democratic voters who have helped keep Ms. Collins comfortably in office for years. It also set the stage and tone for the impeachment fight.What appears to rankle Ms. Collins is the suggestion that her votes are mere political calculations. She often says she consults a bevy of experts, reams of transcripts and scores of interviews with people who have a personal stake in a policy outcome.To prepare for Mr. Trump's trial, she met with specialists from the legal division at the Congressional Research Service and had her staff put together a huge notebook about the 1999 trial procedures. She has read myriad transcripts of the House hearings and reports on the Ukraine matter and Mr. Trump, she said.\"I felt that the process that we followed in 1999 worked really well and produced a fair outcome,\" she said, including the decision to call witnesses and examine additional evidence, which most Republicans are resisting this time around.In voting for witnesses but rejecting one or both charges against Mr. Trump, Ms. Collins might anticipate she can satisfy both Maine Republicans, many of whom are very loyal to the president, and the many Democrats and independents she has always relied on for her victories.But that is far from clear in such a hyperpartisan environment. And she will be running for re-election against several opponents in November, including Sara Gideon, the Democratic speaker of Maine's House.\"I am definitely expecting this to be an all-out brawl from both left and right groups, along with the candidate and party spending,\" said Michael M. Franz, a co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising spending.Maine's race already surpassed all other Senate races in terms of campaign spending for 2019, Mr. Franz said. \"All told, I don't expect either side to be dramatically outspent, since pro-Democrat groups see this election as one of their likeliest prospects,\" he said.Compromise legislation of the sort that used to help lawmakers in Maine, where voters love independence, is increasingly rare in Congress these days. (A notable exception is the recent North American trade agreement.)Polls show approval ratings for Ms. Collins, long one of the nation's most popular senators, dipping.\"Maine has a kind of model of what they want a political figure to look like, which has elements of being respected nationally, civility and a certain degree of bipartisanship and independence,\" said Amy Fried, the chairwoman of the department of political science at the University of Maine. \"However in today's politics she has been pushed out of that.\"For example, Ms. Fried said, although Ms. Collins is seen as supportive of abortion rights and pro-environment, political advocacy groups that press for those issues are not likely to support her this year.\"Senator Collins is now the most unpopular senator in the country because she's shown over and over again that she will put the needs of corporate special interests and Mitch McConnell ahead of Mainers,\" said Kathleen Marra, the chairwoman of the Maine Democratic Party, who says there has been a tremendous surge in enthusiasm and volunteer engagement in her state.Yet incumbency can be a powerful force. Ms. Collins is known as a shrewd politician who has built ties to every part of the state and labors to scrape together benefits for its shipyards, lobstermen and large elderly population and to promote them when at home.Impeachment could be a wild card.\"I feel confident she is beatable, but don't feel confident she will definitely lose yet,\" said Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, one of the many groups spending millions of dollars to highlight Ms. Collins's Kavanaugh vote. \"It is still going to take a lot of work.\"PhotographSenator Susan Collins said she would use the \"same standard\" she followed in the 1999 trial.

The setting was Mar-a-Lago, President Trump's private club in Palm Beach, Fla. The guest list included dozens of Trump family members and friends.But when it came to picking up the tab, hands went out to other attendees. Among them were at least four whose families are financial supporters of the president's re-election campaign, for which Ms. Guilfoyle helps lead the fund-raising. They ended up pitching in tens of thousands of dollars, passed along to Mar-a-Lago, to help pay for what two people familiar with the planning said was a $50,000 celebration of Ms. Guilfoyle's 51st birthday.The hourslong bash on the evening of March 7 has since emerged as a snapshot of the cavalier way Mr. Trump and his team initially handled the coronavirus outbreak. At least one attendee -- a Brazilian government official who stopped by the party briefly -- has tested positive for the virus, while another -- Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida -- self-quarantined, though he later announced he had tested negative for the virus.But the funding provided for the party by Mr. Trump's supporters, which has not been previously reported, also underscored other characteristics that have defined his political career: His reliance on other people's money rather than his own fortune, and the overlap between the president's private and public roles.Brendan Fischer, an official at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group, called the party \"an illustration of the blurred lines between Trump's presidency, his campaign, and his family's personal and financial interests.\"At the very least, he said, the party created the appearance of supporters of the president currying favor with his family by steering money into his private business, which he continues to profit from.\"This may not be illegal, but it is incredibly unethical,\" he said.Even some in Mr. Trump's orbit worried that it would look unsavory to accept money from political donors for the celebration at a time when coronavirus fears were spreading, according to people familiar with the concerns.The party was organized with the assistance of Caroline Wren, a veteran Republican fund-raiser who sent out invitations and gave a speech at the party thanking attendees who chipped in, according to people familiar with the planning.Ms. Wren is a finance consultant to an arm of Mr. Trump's re-election apparatus called Trump Victory, for which Ms. Guilfoyle is the chairwoman of the finance committee. Trump Victory is a joint fund-raising committee formed by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, and is Mr. Trump's primary means of raising six-figure campaign donations.The committee was hosting major donors at a spring retreat in Palm Beach the same weekend as the party, drawing many of Mr. Trump's top financial backers to the area for events, including some at Mar-a-Lago. Ms. Guilfoyle's birthday party became a coveted ticket for donors.Ms. Wren said in a statement that she had been friends with Ms. Guilfoyle for several years and \"volunteered to assist Kimberly during her birthday party celebrations.\"\"This was not a campaign event, nor an R.N.C. event,\" she continued, \"and anything I assisted with was in my private and personal capacity.\"Michael Ahrens, a spokesman for the R.N.C., said that the party committee and Trump Victory \"were not involved in the organization or financing\" of Ms. Guilfoyle's party.The White House declined to comment on the party, and why the president did not pay for it himself.The chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel, who spent time at Mar-a-Lago during the retreat but did not attend the birthday party, fell ill after the weekend, as did a fund-raiser who works with Ms. Guilfoyle. Both are awaiting results of tests for the coronavirus.The birthday party had the feel of a Trump campaign event, according to attendees. The invitees included a panoply of administration officials, campaign figures, political allies and major donors to Trump Victory, many of them both personal and professional friends to Ms. Guilfoyle.Ivanka Trump thanked Ms. Guilfoyle for working \"so, so hard for the president,\" a video of the event showed. After the president joined the crowd in singing happy birthday to Ms. Guilfoyle, she chanted, \"Four more years!\"And Donald Trump Jr. reportedly joked that Ms. Guilfoyle would be soliciting contributions for his father's re-election from party attendees.\"You are in this room for a reason,\" he said, according to The Washington Examiner. \"You guys have been the warriors, the fighters, the people who have been there every time we have made a call, every time we made a request.\"The money given to pay for the party went to Mar-a-Lago, though it is unclear if each donor individually paid the club, or if the money was pooled and paid to the club by a member, who could put the expenses on an account. Donald Trump Jr. and another attendee, John W. Giordano, a lawyer and Republican donor, are members of the club. People involved in the planning said the attendees were not solicited as part of an organized fund-raising effort.Ms. Guilfoyle declined to answer detailed questions about the party, including who facilitated the contributions. In an email, a spokeswoman for Ms. Guilfoyle said: \"All of the people who offered to support this evening have been longtime friends of Kimberly's. None of them have to donate to see her.\"But one of the donors, Madhavan Padmakumar, an information technology executive from New York, said he had never met Ms. Guilfoyle. Mr. Padmakumar traveled to Palm Beach as part of a delegation of Indian-Americans attending the Republican Party donor retreat.Mr. Padmakumar said he attended Ms. Guilfoyle's party with a leader of the Indian-American delegation, Al Mason, a real estate investor and Trump fund-raiser who is friendly with Ms. Guilfoyle. Mr. Padmakumar agreed to pay $10,000 to help fund the celebration because \"I was keen to have my name promoted,\" he said in the text message. He noted that he was \"announced\" as one of the \"sponsors of the party.\"He also said he donated to Mr. Trump's campaign at the retreat.Mr. Padmakumar, who had never visited Mar-a-Lago, said he \"always wanted to go and see\" it, and recalled seeing the president and his family \"all cut the cake.\"Others who contributed funds for the party were longer-term supporters of Mr. Trump's campaign.They included the New York supermarket billionaire John A. Catsimatidis, who chipped in $10,000, according to people familiar with the arrangement. His daughter Andrea Catsimatidis, a longtime friend of Ms. Guilfoyle's, attended the party.In a statement, Mr. Catsimatidis described his donation as strictly motivated by a two-decade friendship with Ms. Guilfoyle. \"I am always happy to support my friends,\" he said.Another contributor to the festivities was Catharine P. O'Neill, whose father is a major Trump donor. She worked as a staff assistant in the State Department after Mr. Trump took office and became a fixture in Washington's pro-Trump social scene.Also helping to finance the celebration was Mr. Giordano, who had advised Mr. Trump's campaign and transition and had been rumored to be in contention for a position in his administration as a United States attorney. He is a partner in the government-affairs division of Archer, a Philadelphia-area law firm with a substantial lobbying business.The key question in determining whether the arrangement crossed legal lines, said Mr. Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, could be whether the attendees who contributed to the party would have done so even if Mr. Trump were not the president running for re-election.He said that if the donors gave only because Mr. Trump is a candidate, then \"there could be an argument that they made contributions to Trump's campaign,\" which would need to be reported to the Federal Election Commission.Another attendee who is friendly with Ms. Guilfoyle asked the head of a Miami marketing and advertising agency to provide liquor for an after-party. The marketing executive turned to a Florida tequila company, Don Sueños, which sent over two cases for Ms. Guilfoyle's party.It was \"just to get our name out there,\" said Tre Zimmerman, whose wife is the company's owner. \"I don't know Kimberly.\"Not all the attendees were asked to contribute, said Doug Deason, a Dallas businessman and Trump donor. Mr. Deason was invited by Ms. Guilfoyle after they chatted at the Trump International Hotel in Washington a week earlier.\"I was not asked to sponsor her birthday party and I don't know of anyone who was,\" Mr. Deason said in a text message.Mr. Deason said he and his wife were seated at a table \"right behind the head table,\" but left before \"the dancing.\"A video shows partygoers forming a \"Trump Train\" conga line to the song \"Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,\" by Gloria Estefan.Kenneth P.

But job growth has stalled in the state, and Democrats accused him of failing to live up to his promise of restoring manufacturing in the region.Standing in front of a giant American flag, the president celebrated his decision to order a drone strike killing the Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, calling him \"the world's top terrorist\" and insisting that he was planning to attack American embassies despite doubts about the intelligence. \"He was a bad guy,\" Mr. Trump told a cheering crowd at the Huntington Center, a minor-league hockey arena. \"He was a bloodthirsty terror and he's no longer a terror. He's dead.\"Hours after House Democrats passed a resolution intended to limit Mr. Trump's ability to wage war without congressional permission, the president said Speaker Nancy Pelosi had her priorities wrong.\"I see the radical left Democrats have expressed outrage over the termination of this horrible terrorist,\" he said. \"And you know, instead, they should be outraged by Suleimani's savage crimes.\"At the mention of Ms. Pelosi, who he said is \"not operating with a full deck,\" some in the crowd shouted: \"Lock her up! Lock her up!\"Mr. Trump also singled out Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, offering a parody version of the congressman supposedly preferring to talk about taking out a terrorist instead of actually doing so. \"You little pencil neck,\" Mr. Trump then said derisively, as if addressing Mr. Schiff.He made no mention of his decision to back away from further military action after Iran's missile strikes on Iraqi bases housing American troops, which resulted in no casualties. Nor did he mention the Ukrainian civilian airliner that Western intelligence agencies concluded was shot down by Iranian missiles, most likely by mistake.The crowd was broadly supportive of his tough talk on Iran and Democrats. But several demonstrators disrupted the president's speech, holding up hand-drawn signs saying \"NO WAR\" before being evicted by security officers.Democratic leaders have said they agree that General Suleimani had American blood on his hands and do not mourn his death. But they have accused Mr. Trump of approving a reckless action on flimsy claims that risked a wider war with Iran and undermined American interests in the region by alienating allies like Iraq.\"This week, you put our sons and daughters in harm's way when you abandoned diplomacy, rejected our allies, and escalated conflict in the Middle East and around the world,\" Representative Marcy Kaptur, the longtime Democratic congresswoman from Toledo, wrote Mr. Trump in an open letter posted on her website before the rally. \"It causes one to wonder if anyone from the Trump family has ever served in the U.S. military or in a foreign war.Mr. Trump's trip to Ohio was the 15th of his presidency. Awaiting him was Vice President Mike Pence and an arena full of enthusiastic supporters, many decked out in classic red \"Make America Great Again\" baseball caps and waving \"Keep America Great\" placards. Outside the arena were smaller but energized crowds of protesters, many of them waving union signs or handmade banners, like \"Dump Trump.\"It was a typical Trump performance, rambling and disjointed, loose and entertaining, full of invective for his enemies and the news media, peppered with false and misleading assertions and soaked in by the appreciative crowd. In the best-hits portion of the evening, he revisited the 2016 election, as he likes to do, quoting himself, as he also likes to do, as well as anyone else who ever said anything positive about him, whether they actually did or not.At one point, he said that he was viewed more positively by Republicans in one poll than Abraham Lincoln.\"Who do you like better, Trump or Abraham Lincoln?\" he said, recalling the survey question. Some in the crowd shouted out their answer: \"Trump! Trump!\" although many others did not join in, perhaps quiet Lincoln admirers.Mr. Trump said he shared the result of the poll with his wife, addressing her by her title. \"I said, 'First Lady, I just beat Abraham Lincoln in a poll,\"' he said.At another point, the president began riffing about the various Democrats running against him before lamenting that they were boring. Watching them, he said, \"is like watching death.\" Which might explain why he spent time recycling some of his favorite attacks on former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who is no longer even in the race.Toward the end, after an extended attack on Democrats as corrupt, crime-loving socialists who are \"stone-cold crazy,\" Mr. Trump suddenly stopped and reflected on his own language. \"Gee,\" he said, \"now I sort of understand why they hate me.\"Mr. Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points in 2016, and the state has been the bedrock of every winning Republican presidential candidate going back to the 19th century. Polling in Ohio last fall showed Mr. Trump trailing some of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates in hypothetical matchups, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont by six percentage points and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts by four points, but there has been little recent independent public surveying in the state.In few places will the economic argument be as important for Mr. Trump's chances of winning a second term as in the Midwest, where he vowed to rebuild a manufacturing industry that has struggled in recent decades.\"The betrayal of Ohio workers and American workers ended the day I took the oath of office,\" he said, citing his revised version of the North American Free Trade Agreement and his trade war with China. \"Ohio just had the best year economically in the history of your state,\" he claimed at another point, \"and this year is going to be even better, maybe much better.\"In fact, unemployment in Ohio fell from a high of 11.1 percent in 2010 to 4.9 percent under President Barack Obama. After Mr. Trump took over, it continued to fall to 4.0 percent by last summer, although in recent months it ticked back up to 4.2 percent. It remains higher than the national rate and among the 10 states with the highest in the country. The state lost 4,400 jobs last year through November and shed 2,200 manufacturing jobs over the previous year.Ohio Democrats welcomed the president to the state by attacking his \"failed policies,\" like the \"trade war by tweet,\" as David Pepper, the state party chairman, put it. \"Donald Trump has broken his promises on jobs, on trade, on health care, on education and on so much more,\" Mr. Pepper told reporters.Mr. Trump will ramp up campaign travel as the year progresses and Democrats begin voting to choose their nominee. He has rallies scheduled in the next few weeks in Milwaukee, to build support in another key Midwest battleground, and Wildwood, N.J., to campaign with Representative Jeff Van Drew, who left the Democratic Party over impeachment.PhotographAt a campaign rally in Toledo, Ohio, on Thursday night, President Trump painted Democrats as sympathetic to terrorists.

His namesake hotel is abuzz with Secret Service agents, supporters and the simply curious.LAS VEGAS -- When Elaine and Robert Jacobs of Mansfield, Ohio, checked in for their three-night time-share vacation on Monday, the receptionist told them to expect tight security.\"We asked why,\" Ms. Jacobs said. \"And we heard, 'Well, the president's coming.\"'The Trump International Hotel, which hosts Hilton time-shares, is a glassy, golden high-rise at the north edge of the Las Vegas Strip. Starting Tuesday, it will host President Trump for three nights, just as the leading Democratic presidential candidates debate on Wednesday at another hotel less than two miles away, and the Nevada Democratic Party prepares to caucus on Saturday to select a nominee.Mr. Trump, who has declined to spend the night in other early-voting states he is visiting, is scheduled to hold a campaign event of his own at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Friday afternoon.Preparing for Mr. Trump's arrival, his namesake hotel was abuzz on Monday, with federal law enforcement officers surveying the property; Trump supporters eyeing branded dog toys in the gift shop; and hotel staff members tossing pristine-looking bouquets of red amaryllis into trash bags and replacing them with new buds.Carl and Sara Shupe were visiting Las Vegas from Minnesota to renew their wedding vows. Mr. Shupe had packed a gray \"Trump-Pence\" T-shirt, which he wore Monday while taking in the hotel lobby. \"He always travels with Trump,\" Mrs. Shupe joked, gesturing at his shirt, though her husband added that he couldn't wear it in front of his mother-in-law, who disapproved of the president.\"I hope the Democrats' best candidate comes forward and we get a race,\" said Mr. Shupe, an Army veteran who owns a construction business. He had voted for Barack Obama, he said, but had been disappointed. \"The reason I voted for Trump is because I want people out of Washington, Republicans and Democrats alike. I want term limits. I want to make sure we just kind of flush the toilet and start over.\"Fox News and Fox Business played on two of the oversize televisions in the \"DJT\" restaurant set within the lobby -- a diminutive lobby by Las Vegas standards, but punctuated by ornate chandeliers and three columns of hanging crystals. Restaurant guests scanned menus featuring Trump wines and cocktails like \"The Smoking Old-Fashioned Billionaire,\" with rye whiskey, and \"Death by Trial,\" a rum drink with citrus.Mr. Trump's hotels have had mixed performance since his election, with some like the Trump National Doral near Miami showing significant declines in revenue since 2015 -- in part because some customers and corporate sponsors have avoided the resort, as Mr. Trump himself has acknowledged. Other Trump-branded hotels, in Panama City, Toronto and the SoHo neighborhood of New York, have dropped the Trump brand, after protests by owners or other friction.But the Las Vegas hotel has been among the better performers in the Trump portfolio, bringing in more than $30 million a year from hotel and condo sales that have been fairly steady since Mr. Trump was elected.Ty Wilfon, a firefighter from Albuquerque, browsed the Trump store with his wife and sons, who inspected chocolates made to look like bars of gold and stamped with the president's name. A dozen miniature ones cost $21.The Wilfons had just sold a house and were visiting Las Vegas to celebrate. \"I'm obviously a Donald Trump supporter,\" Mr. Wilfon said, as he looked for ties in the shop but couldn't justify the $125 asking price. \"With the whole impeachment thing, it makes me support Trump more,\" he said, calling the 2020 race \"pretty crazy\" and adding he thought Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii was the Democrats' strongest candidate.Beckey and Ricky Langley, small-business owners from Washington State, had ducked into the hotel to see the scene. They called themselves moderates who had been hesitant to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016 but were won over by how the economy had performed in his first term, helping their storm-drain-cleaning business boom and making them enthusiastic about his re-election bid.\"Right now, I think I do identify with the Republican Party, but I think it's more because of what the opposition shows,\" Ms. Langley said, calling Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota the only acceptable candidate in the primary race.\"The Democrats are just imploding,\" Mr. Langley said. \"They've gone so far left, so far overboard.\"One restaurant server tending to tables in the lobby said she had already voted in the Democratic caucus. Four hotels along the Strip had converted employee dining areas into pop-up early-voting sites over the holiday weekend. One hotel, the Bellagio, offered 24-hour voting that wound down on Monday.With 1,282 rooms, the Trump hotel was offering a range of accommodations for the night of the president's arrival Tuesday, with rooms starting at $140, according to its website. Some third-party booking sites touted even better deals. \"The exterior windows are, of course, gilded in glistening 24-carat gold,\" the booking app HotelTonight said, offering a rate of $101. \"Lack of casino creates a more peaceful Vegas experience.\"Some guests didn't find the prospect of a presidential entourage so peaceful. \"I can't talk about it because I'm going to get too upset,\" one woman said, declining to say anything more.\"He's the president, and he is to be respected no matter what,\" another guest said, declining to give her name. \"But we're not Trump supporters,\" the man she was with called over his shoulder as they walked away.The Jacobses from Ohio said they liked the Trump hotel for its large rooms and quieter location, even if they were not fans of Mr. Trump himself. \"If it didn't say Trump, I'd be thrilled,\" Ms. Jacobs said, pointing to the hotel sign.\"He's a little crazy,\" Mr. Jacobs said. \"But we have 401(k)'s,\" he said, calling Mr. Trump good for the economy and adding that the couple liked the two former mayors in the race -- Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Michael R. Bloomberg of New York -- best of the Democratic contenders.Aaron Chuang, who manages a car dealership in Toronto and was visiting Las Vegas for a conference, called his decision to stay at the Trump hotel this week one of pure economics. \"I used my uncle's free Hilton points,\" Mr. Chuang said, adding about Mr. Trump: \"I wouldn't stay here otherwise. I don't like him.\"For others, the opportunity to stay at the hotel along with the president was cause for celebration. Joseph Mazza, who flew in from Boston with two friends for his 30th birthday, checked in Monday afternoon. Mr. Mazza, who works in finance, said he had attended Mr. Trump's rally in New Hampshire this month, and he praised his deregulation efforts and corporate tax cuts. \"I'm a big fan,\" he said.PhotographPresident Trump will be staying at his hotel in Las Vegas this week, while Democrats have a debate at the Paris Theater on Wednesday.

All persons are commanded to keep silent upon pain of imprisonment.\"Those words, an echo of another time, came from Michael C. Stenger, the Senate sergeant-at-arms, and fell upon a hushed Senate chamber just after noon on Thursday. The impeachment trial of Donald John Trump, the 45th president of the United States, on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors was about to begin.Two hours later, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., in flowing black robes, escorted by four senators, strode into the room to open the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.\"When the chief justice walked in, you could feel the weight of the moment,\" Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said later. \"I saw members on both sides of the aisle visibly gulp.\"Chief Justice Roberts, who will preside over the trial, was sworn in by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the Senate pro tempore -- a post he holds because he is the longest-serving member of the majority.Mr. Grassley administered the oath, which dates to the 1700s: \"I solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me God.\"Chief Justice Roberts then administered the same oath to the senators, who rose in unison, raised their right hands and swore to administer \"impartial justice.\"One by one, in alphabetical order, the senators then proceeded to the well of the chamber to sign an \"oath book\" -- an affirmation in writing of the vow they had just taken.In a proceeding laden with history and tradition, the oath book is a relatively recent convention; it dates to 1986, when the Senate updated its impeachment rules for the television era.Earlier in the day, the seven Democrats appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi as \"impeachment managers\" to prosecute the House's case walked two-by-two across the Capitol to the Senate chamber. They had already delivered two articles of impeachment, one on abuse of power and the other on obstruction of Congress, to the Senate on Wednesday evening. Now they were invited to \"exhibit\" -- or read them aloud -- in the chamber at noon on Thursday.Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead impeachment manager, delivered the formal accusation from the House: President Trump had committed \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" by withholding military aid from Ukraine to help himself win the 2020 election, and then concealed his actions from Congress.\"President Trump,\" Mr. Schiff said, \"warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.\"There were signs all over the Capitol that this was a different kind of day.The Capitol Police officers, who have the option to wear turtlenecks, wore ties with their dress blue uniforms. Areas ordinarily open to the news media and visitors were cordoned off with golden stanchions and crimson velvet ropes. Reporters and staff members were issued special color-coded badges -- maroon for the news media, brown for Senate staff -- to gain entry to the Senate side of the Capitol.The highly orchestrated rituals of the impeachment trial began on Wednesday, when the House voted, largely along party lines, to transmit the articles to the Senate and appoint the impeachment managers.Ms. Pelosi needed to sign them, and she did so during a formal \"engrossment ceremony,\" using more than a dozen black and gold pens that were laid out on silver trays. (Later she gave the pens as mementos to committee leaders and other Democrats who played a role in the House impeachment inquiry.)Mr. Schiff and his team then walked slowly in a procession through the Capitol, through Statuary Hall and the Rotunda, to deliver the articles to the Senate.Mr. Trump's trial will reconvene at 1 p.m. Tuesday. On his way out of the Capitol, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, reflected on what was going through his mind as the chief justice administered the oath.\"The gravity of what we are undertaking, I think, is sinking in for all of us,\" he said.PhotographChief Justice John G.

You know that, right?\" he added, turning to his guest.Mr. Netanyahu grinned. \"Both sides,\" he replied.The Israeli leader will return to the White House for meetings Monday and Tuesday, and Mr. Trump is expected at last to lay out the details of that long-awaited plan. Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday he hoped to \"make history\" on the visit.But far from a bold effort to bring old enemies together -- one that demands painful concessions from both sides -- Middle East experts now expect the plan to be mainly a booster shot for Mr. Netanyahu's desperate campaign to stay in power.Benny Gantz, again Mr. Netanyahu's rival in Israel's third election in less than a year, will have his own separate meeting with Mr. Trump on Monday. He had at first resisted the invitation, fearing a political trap in which Mr. Netanyahu would get to play the statesman while Mr. Gantz would look puny by comparison. But analysts said he could not afford to snub the president, given Mr. Trump's enduring popularity in Israel.The Palestinians, who stopped talking to Mr. Trump after he ordered the United States Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in December 2017, will not be at the White House to be briefed on the plan. They have vowed to reject it.\"For him to do this in the middle of an Israeli election, without any Palestinian participation and with no intention to follow up with any of the participants, shows this is not a peace plan at all,\" said Martin S. Indyk, who served as special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations under President Barack Obama.\"It is a farce from start to finish,\" he said.Mr. Indyk's verdict is harsh but not uncommon among diplomats who have worked on past peace efforts. Like other veterans of those fruitless negotiations, in both Democratic and Republican administrations, Mr. Indyk watched the early days of Mr. Trump's diplomacy with fascination and even muted hope -- that this most undiplomatic of presidents might achieve a breakthrough where they had failed.That triumph of hope over experience was shared by some in the region. Palestinians and Israelis took to calling it Mr. Trump's \"deal of the century,\" outdoing his own description of it as the \"ultimate deal.\"The president brought a deal maker's swagger and a property developer's instincts to a problem that, after all, involves disputed territory. His close ties to Mr. Netanyahu -- something Mr. Obama lacked -- raised hopes that he might be able to extract real concessions from Israel. In a sign of the importance Mr. Trump attached to the effort, he put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of it.Mr. Kushner led a team that included Jason D. Greenblatt, the Trump Organization's former chief lawyer, and David M. Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer with ties to the Jewish settler movement who became Mr. Trump's ambassador to Israel. He would emerge as the most influential adviser to Mr. Trump on Israel.For months, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt traveled around the Middle East, meeting with Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and other nations. Their strategy, known as \"outside-in,\" was designed to build a coalition of Arab support for a peace plan. The Arab leaders, the White House hoped, would pressure the Palestinian Authority to accept whatever Mr. Trump offered.Mr. Kushner devoted particular attention to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, with whom he had cultivated a friendship of like-minded scions. Prince Mohammed expressed a willingness to establish relations with Israel and said the Israelis \"have the right to have their own land.\"At home, Mr. Trump's pro-Israel supporters were growing restive. They worried that he might put too much pressure on Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Trump told him that a rapid expansion of settlements was not conducive to an agreement. After meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, in May 2017, Mr. Trump said that it was an \"honor\" -- a post that later vanished from his Twitter feed.Any such worries, however, were laid to rest seven months later when Mr. Trump announced he would move the embassy, formally recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The move delighted evangelicals, as well as pro-Israel donors like Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino magnate.But it drove away the Palestinians, who cut off contact with the White House, and doomed the White House's efforts to build Arab support for its plan. King Salman of Saudi Arabia was among those who condemned the decision, declaring, \"East Jerusalem is an integral part of the Palestinian territories.\"Mr. Trump reacted harshly to the Palestinian rejection. He punished them by cutting off hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinian Authority, as well as funding for the United Nations agency that helps Palestinian refugees.The State Department shut down the office of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Washington. It downgraded the American consulate in Jerusalem, which had been a key channel to the Palestinians, by merging it with the embassy under Mr. Friedman, who later said Israel had the right to annex parts of the West Bank.Even as the rift with the Palestinians widened, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt labored on their plan. Working under a veil of secrecy, they compiled a multipage document, with annexes, that officials said would propose solutions to all the key disputes: borders, security, refugees and the status of Jerusalem.While the plan never leaked -- a rarity in the sievelike world of Middle East diplomacy -- its general contours became known. It is not expected to call for a two-state solution or give East Jerusalem to the Palestinians. Nor will it offer Palestinian refugees a right of return or other compensation.Mr. Kushner and Mr. Greenblatt, who has since left the administration, predicted in March 2018 that the Israelis and the Palestinians would each find things in the plan to embrace and oppose. But it was already clear that it would be tilted heavily in Israel's favor -- or more precisely, in the favor of their embattled ally, Mr. Netanyahu.Facing indictment on multiple corruption charges in early 2019, the prime minister was fighting for his political life. With Mr. Netanyahu facing a closely fought election that April, Mr. Trump gave him an election-eve gift, announcing in March that the United States would reverse decades of policy and recognize Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which was seized by Israeli troops in 1967.With the release of his plan stymied by the instability in Israel, Mr. Kushner turned his attention to economics. In June, he announced the United States would raise more than $50 billion to improve the lives of the Palestinians and their Arab neighbors. His 38-page plan, titled \"Peace to Prosperity,\" had slick graphics and the promotional tone of a real estate prospectus.Mr. Kushner followed up with a two-day workshop in Bahrain, which was boycotted by the Palestinians and shrugged off by other Arab leaders, for whom the peace project had faded into irrelevance.Even after Mr. Trump's shift on the Golan Heights, Mr. Netanyahu was unable to cobble together a majority to form a government. After a second election, in September, he found himself again short of a majority.If Mr. Trump releases his plan this week, analysts said, it will be less about delivering the \"deal of the century\" than giving Mr. Netanyahu one last electoral lift.PhotographPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, left, with Jared Kushner.

Barr on Wednesday for intervening to lower the Justice Department's sentencing recommendation for the president's longtime friend Roger J. Stone Jr., calling his prosecution \"a disgrace\" for which he deserves an apology.In sharply worded tweets and comments to reporters, Mr. Trump dismissed criticism that the Justice Department was abandoning its traditional independence by responding to his unhappiness with the recommendation that Mr. Stone serve up to nine years in prison for obstructing a congressional inquiry.\"Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought,\" Mr. Trump tweeted. He compared the Stone case to the Russia investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel.\"Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!\" Mr. Trump said, though he did not explain the accusation against Mr. Mueller, a former F.B.I. director.Mr. Trump's comments came less than 24 hours after four career prosecutors withdrew from the Stone case after senior officials at the department overruled the seven- to nine-year term they had recommended Mr. Stone receive. One of the prosecutors also resigned from the Justice Department, where he worked in the public integrity section.The reaction by the prosecutors and the president's subsequent comments roiled Washington for a second day as Democratic lawmakers, former law enforcement officials and ethics watchdog groups accused Mr. Trump of abusing the power of his office to influence the Justice Department in a continuing criminal case.Eric H. Holder Jr., who served as attorney general under President Barack Obama, called the situation \"unprecedented.\" Walter M. Shaub Jr., the former director of the Office of Government Ethics, likened Tuesday's actions by Mr. Trump and the Justice Department to those in countries with authoritarian regimes.\"A corrupt authoritarian and his henchmen are wielding the Justice Department as a shield for friends and a sword for political rivals,\" Mr. Shaub said Wednesday in a Twitter post. \"It is impossible to overstate the danger.\"Mr. Stone was convicted in November of obstructing the House Intelligence Committee's examination of Russian interference in the 2016 election by lying to investigators under oath and trying to block the testimony of a witness who would have exposed his lies.The initial sentencing recommendation for Mr. Stone was filed late Monday. On Tuesday, it was amended and refiled stating that the earlier version \"did not accurately reflect the Department of Justice's position on what would be a reasonable sentence in this matter.\" The department instead suggested an unspecified term.The department's action followed a Fox News report on the recommendation and a Twitter post by Mr. Trump, who said: \"This is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!\"The decision to override the recommended sentence was made by officials from the offices of Mr. Barr and the deputy attorney general. The Justice Department said on Tuesday that the case was not discussed with anyone at the White House.Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office before meeting with President Lenín Moreno of Ecuador on Wednesday, Mr. Trump denied that his tweet about Mr. Barr was political and called the prosecution of Mr. Stone \"a disgrace.\"Asked whether he would pardon Mr. Stone, the president said, \"I don't want to say that yet, but I tell you what: People were hurt viciously and badly by these corrupt people.\"He added that it was unfair that prosecutors recommended that Mr. Stone be sentenced to nine years in prison when James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, has not been jailed. He said that prosecutors \"ought to apologize to him.\"\"You have murderers and drug addicts that don't get nine years,\" the president said. \"Nine years for doing something that no one can even define what he did.\"\"In the meantime, Comey walks around making book deals,\" Mr. Trump lamented.Presidents have typically avoided interfering in Justice Department decisions to avoid allegations of improper influence, though there is no law against it. Mr. Trump has publicly inserted himself into several department matters, in some instances to protect friends like Mr. Stone and to direct investigations into his political rivals.The president has also demanded loyalty from his subordinates and has repeatedly praised Mr. Barr's leadership of the department.But the unusual step of overruling the decisions of career prosecutors, particularly in such a politically charged case, reinforced concerns by Democrats and others that Mr. Trump was tipping the scales of justice in favor of his interests.\"I do not take a position on the proper prison term for Mr. Stone, but it would be a blatant abuse of power if President Trump has in fact intervened to reverse the recommendations of career prosecutors at the Department of Justice,\" said Representative Adam B. Schiff, a California Democrat who led the House's impeachment of the president.Mr. Schiff is also the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which Mr. Stone was convicted of obstructing.Mr. Holder said in a Twitter post just after midnight on Wednesday, \"This affects the rule of law and respect for it.\"\"Do not underestimate the danger of this situation: the political appointees in the DOJ are involving themselves in an inappropriate way in cases involving political allies of the President,\" he added.Nicholas Fandos and Catie Edmondson contributed reporting.PhotographRoger Stone was convicted of lying to investigators under oath in an inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Dershowitz, prompted a backlash. He said he was misinterpreted.WASHINGTON -- When a lawyer for President Trump suggested to senators this week that whatever a president does in pursuit of re-election is inherently in the public's interest, the moment crystallized fears among some of Mr. Trump's critics about creeping presidential autocracy.\"If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,\" said the lawyer, Alan M. Dershowitz. He sought on Thursday to clarify or walk back his remarks, saying on Twitter that they were mischaracterized.But the wave of outrage underscored how the politics of the Trump era -- and his lawyers' efforts to help Mr. Trump advance his agenda and defend himself from scrutiny -- have become infused with concerns about executive power overreach.The constitutional system is built on the idea that each of the three branches of government depends upon and is accountable to the others, said Peter Shane, an Ohio State University law professor and co-author of a separation-of-powers casebook, but an accumulating pattern of claims and actions by the Trump administration has called that into doubt.\"What is scary about Trump's view of executive power is that he tries to do as much as he can without the sanction of Congress, and to resist oversight by the other branches,\" Mr. Shane said. \"Put all that together and you get a picture of an executive branch in which all activity is subject to the whim of the president, and how that whim is exercised cannot be effectively checked.\"The list of ways in which Mr. Trump and his legal team have pushed limits is growing.In the Ukraine affair, his lawyers have argued that nothing is impeachable or illegal about using his official powers to coerce a weak ally to announce a corruption investigation into a domestic political rival, and the Senate's Republican majority will likely vote to acquit him.Along the way, Mr. Trump's legal team came up with a theory by which the executive branch could lawfully withhold from Congress a whistle-blower complaint that an inspector general had deemed an \"urgent concern.\" A law says that the administration \"shall\" disclose such a complaint to lawmakers.And before the Ukraine affair came to light, lawyers in the White House budget office developed a legal theory that Mr. Trump had constitutional authority to withhold congressionally mandated military aid from Ukraine, overriding the Anti-Impoundment Act. They never activated that theory, since he released the aid after the whistle-blower filed his complaint.The president's edgy views of executive power did not start with Ukraine. Mr. Trump himself has repeatedly claimed that Article II of the Constitution, which creates the presidency, gives him \"the right to do whatever I want.\"He has said he could pardon himself and vowed to systematically stonewall \"all\" congressional subpoenas.Mr. Trump broke with a long-held norm by personally ordering an investigation into the Russia investigators, and he repeatedly tried to impede the special counsel inquiry, boasting that he has \"an absolute right to do what I want to with the Justice Department.\"After William P. Barr, a longtime believer in a maximalist interpretation of presidential power, privately provided the Trump administration with a legal theory by which obstruction of justice laws do not apply to presidents who abuse their power over the Justice Department, Mr. Trump appointed him attorney general.In domestic policy, Mr. Trump has pushed the limits of emergency powers laws to claim a right to spend more taxpayer money on a border wall with Mexico than Congress was willing to appropriate. In foreign policy, he launched strikes at the Syrian government without permission from Congress, and nearly brought the country to war with Iran by killing a senior Iranian general without consulting lawmakers.Against the backdrop of all this and more, critics of Mr. Trump seized on Mr. Dershowitz's remarks. The leader of the House impeachment managers, Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, told the Senate on Thursday that Mr. Trump's team had embraced the vision of a presidency that exists above the law -- \"when the president does it, that means it is not illegal\" -- that Richard Nixon famously articulated to defend his conduct after Watergate.\"We are right back to where we were a half-century ago -- and I would argue we may be in a worse place because this time, this time that argument may succeed,\" Mr. Schiff said, accusing Trump defenders of embracing \"the normalization of lawlessness\" by a president.Mr. Dershowitz did not attend the impeachment trial on Thursday, but another member of the president's defense team, Patrick Philbin, also distanced himself from the impression Mr. Dershowitz had left. At one point he invoked something else Mr. Dershowitz had said, hastening to add, \"And I don't mean in the more radical portion of his explanation of his theory.\"At another point, Mr. Philbin said: \"The suggestion has been made because of Professor Dershowitz's comments that the theory that the president's counsel is advancing is, 'the president can do anything he wants if he thinks it will advance his re-election, any quid pro quo, anything he wants, anything goes,' and that is not true.\"On Twitter, Mr. Dershowitz said that the intended meaning of his remarks the previous evening, which circulated widely on social media and aired repeatedly on television, had been distorted.\"They characterized my argument as if I had said that if a president believes that his re-election was in the national interest, he can do anything,\" Mr. Dershowitz wrote. \"I said nothing like that, as anyone who actually heard what I said can attest.\"At least one part of Mr. Dershowitz's self-defense seemed accurate. Some Democratic senators and other critics accused him of suggesting that even Nixon was not impeachable, despite his clear crimes. But that accusation is incompatible with Mr. Dershowitz's main argument: that an impeachable \"high crime and misdemeanor\" requires an indictable offense.(His embrace of that view was itself disputed. It cuts against the view of most legal scholars, and he himself said in 1998 that he thought a \"technical crime\" was not required to impeach a president who abuses power. He has since disavowed that view, saying he changed his mind after research.)But the context of Mr. Dershowitz's view that abuse of power, absent an indictable crime, is not impeachable provides a guide for sorting through his inflammatory remarks, which were muddled in places.Mr. Dershowitz made his remarks in response to a question posed by a Republican senator about whether quid pro quos are routine in foreign policy. The president's defense team has repeatedly pointed out that administrations commonly withhold assistance as leverage to induce another country to take some step.The talking point elides the distinction between a president who is trying to achieve some public policy goal and one who is trying to obtain a personal benefit. In his answer, Mr. Dershowitz appeared to be attempting to rebut that objection, including by arguing that a president may have more than one motivation for acting.Specifically, he was arguing against the idea that presidents can be impeached for otherwise lawful actions if they are motivated by gaining personal political benefits rather than serving the public interest. One reason this would be folly, he maintained, was that often both motivations will simultaneously exist.(Mr. Trump's legal team has argued that he had a sincere interest in fighting corruption in Ukraine. House impeachment managers have scoffed at that notion and portrayed him as solely motivated by a desire to manufacture a basis to smear a political rival as corrupt.)But as he riffed, Mr. Dershowitz went further than merely observing that presidents routinely think about public opinion -- that is, voter sentiments -- as well as the public good when they weigh potential actions.He also collapsed any distinction between those two motives by saying that politicians often justifiably believe that their re-election would serve the public interest. That part of his remarks went viral.But the larger context was that under Mr. Dershowitz's theory, even a president who nakedly abuses power, without any reference to the purported public good, cannot be impeached -- so long as there is no indictable offense.On Thursday, Mr. Dershowitz emphasized that he was not trying to communicate that presidents wield unfettered power when they are trying to get re-elected.\"Let me be clear once again (as I was in the Senate): a president seeking re-election cannot do anything he wants,\" Mr. Dershowitz wrote on Twitter. \"He is not above the law. He cannot commit crimes.\"But, he argued, a lawful act \"does not become unlawful or impeachable if done with a mixed motive of both promoting the public interest and helping his RE-election.\"PhotographAlan M. Dershowitz arriving at the Capitol. His comments during the Senate trial about the expansive reach of the president's power provoked criticism. He later said he had been misunderstood.

The impeachment proceedings unfolding on Capitol Hill had proved to be a boost for volunteer recruitment and small-dollar donations. The year ended with a blockbuster jobs report and the unemployment rate falling to 3.5 percent, its lowest level since 1969.Mr. Trump was ready to aggressively attack a Democratic field he and his advisers viewed as weak across the board. Few if any of the president's top campaign aides were looking to change the channel.But Mr. Trump's decision to authorize the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, which he has described to friends and allies as a necessary action he was forced to take, has opened up a more uncertain political reality as the president enters an election year. That uncertainty was on display Tuesday night when Iran fired missiles at American forces in Iraq, in its first act of retaliation.Some advisers have highlighted to Mr. Trump the short-term lift the strike could give his re-election prospects, and his campaign has run nearly 800 distinct Facebook ads trumpeting the killing, according to Acronym, a progressive digital strategy group. The ads refer to Mr. Trump's \"leadership as commander in chief\" and direct voters to an \"Official Trump Military Survey,\" which acts as a portal to his campaign website.But whether the strike will help the president win over more voters rests on factors largely outside Mr. Trump's control. How Iran retaliates, and how voters who responded to his 2016 campaign message about ending \"forever wars\" in the Middle East react to a potentially escalating conflict are the two most immediate questions.\"One of the major parts of the Trump coalition is voters who after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan wanted to be much more cautious engaging in an assault with ground troops,\" said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. \"There's a significant number of libertarians and people who are weary about casually getting involved in a conflict with an Arab country that can take decades to resolve.\"In the days since the attack, Mr. Trump has soaked up praise from Republican senators and allies, and aides described him as very comfortable with his decision. Mr. Trump, who has been eager to bask again in the kind of praise he received after ordering the military to bomb Syrian government forces after they used chemical weapons in 2017, has enjoyed his victory lap. He even described in graphic detail to friends the attacks on the American Embassy in Baghdad that preceded the strike against General Suleimani.Mr. Trump pointed out to one person who spoke to him on the phone last week that he had been pressured to take a harder line on Iran by some Republican senators whose support he needs now more than ever amid an impeachment battle. He also indicated that one of his top motivations for the strike was to protect Israel.Still, he resisted entreaties last week from his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to deliver a televised address on the raid, aides said. A White House spokesman did not respond to an email about Mr. Kushner.In his phone conversation last week, Mr. Trump responded that no one knew where things would end when the caller expressed concern that General Suleimani's death could end up starting a war. And he is aware as well of the consequences for his own political future, even while projecting confidence in his decision.The president and his aides have tried to use the response of Democratic presidential candidates as another example of how far left the party's field has tacked.\"He was a monster. And he's no longer a monster; he's dead,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, adding: \"I don't hear too many people other than politicians who are trying to win the presidency. Those are the ones that are complaining. But I don't hear anybody else complaining.\"The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, has targeted 2020 Democratic candidates like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom have called the strike a dangerous escalation.In the case of Ms. Warren, some Trump advisers noted that she had initially called General Suleimani a \"murderer,\" a statement for which she was attacked by some liberal critics.\"In a matter of a few months, the president has taken out two of the most wanted terrorists without American casualties,\" Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, said of General Suleimani and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the ISIS leader killed by American forces in October.\"That's simple and easy to explain and it has forced the Democrats and the professional left to do some convoluted explaining of how removing terrorists makes us more susceptible to terrorism.\"Other administration officials have made a more direct comparison with General Suleimani and Mr. al-Baghdadi. Instead of acknowledging his title, \"general,\" they have focused on his terrorist activities and the number of people whose deaths he was responsible for over the years.But even those allies who have pressed Mr. Trump to confront Iran expressed uncertainty about what is to come, especially when the administration has struggled to explain what it is doing in the days since the strike.One Republican Senate staff member described an afternoon spent phoning the Defense Department to get more information about a draft letter from a senior military officer that suggested plans for a troop withdrawal from Iraq were underway.The answer he received was that Pentagon officials had only seen it on Twitter. It was the Iraqi Embassy that eventually confirmed to the Senate staff members that the letter was, in fact, real, before the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, called an urgent news conference to make it clear that sending the letter had been an \"honest mistake.\"Some officials have highlighted an interview that Gen. David H. Petraeus gave Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" as the best defense yet of Mr. Trump. General Petraeus, who has criticized key administration decisions about Middle East policy, described the killing of General Suleimani as \"bigger than Bin Laden\" and \"bigger than Baghdadi.\"Yet the explanations of what took place have not included key details, or any description of the quality of the intelligence that officials have said led to Mr. Trump's order.Democrats say that Mr. Trump's decision to carry out a strike that two previous presidents had deemed to be too risky will be used against him by voters.Mr. Trump's action on Iran \"reinforces his weaknesses,\" said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, and played into a view of Mr. Trump as a rash decision maker. Voters, he said, are \"very likely to think about his conduct in Iran through that prism.\"Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, said he disagreed. \"Americans want to see their president acting decisively and defending the nation's interests, and that's exactly what President Trump did,\" Mr. Murtaugh said. \"Democrats and much of the media risk appearing as Iran apologists who look to blame America for responding to terrorist acts and plans.\"PhotographBy one count, the Trump campaign has already run nearly 800 Facebook ads trumpeting the killing of Maj.

Only a few rested on the defense table.The contrasting amount of material the two legal teams brought into the Senate chamber to support their initial arguments foreshadowed a broader difference in their approaches to the trial.In its opening days, the House managers have focused on the facts. They are trying to build a clear and coherent story around their theme that the president abused his power -- delving into the details, putting up slides to summarize major points, and playing a well-organized selection of video clips of statements by Mr. Trump and by House witnesses.Eschewing props, the defense team has focused instead on the process. They have used their time to reinforce the House Republican theme that impeachment is a sham and unfair to Mr. Trump -- urging the Senate to swiftly dispose of the case without subpoenaing any additional documents or testimony.Their strategy appears based on a narrative that is familiar from Mr. Trump's Twitter feed and Fox News programming -- that the impeachment is unfair -- and amplify it to a group that already believes it: Mr. Trump's core supporters, a bloc in the Republican Party that can threaten the political future of any Republican senator either by backing a primary challenger or by failing to turn out during a general election.\"They have the senators in mind, but also the broader public,\" said David Alan Sklansky, a Stanford University criminal law professor and former prosecutor. \"The president's side wants to keep the heat on Republican senators to make sure they stay inside the tent.\"Meanwhile, the House managers, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, a former federal prosecutor, are plowing ahead trying to lay out their case that Mr. Trump seriously abused his powers, a message aimed at the voters who will decide his fate in November as well as the senators who are unlikely to remove him now.Wednesday was entirely a one-sided show as the House managers opened three days of opening arguments with the floor entirely to themselvesMr. Schiff led off the House team's case with a polished, confident performance, speaking extemporaneously at some points as he methodically outlined the Democratic case with the style of the former prosecutor he is. He dispensed with some of the more grandiose language that has occasionally flavored Democratic speeches against Mr. Trump and tried to link together the testimony and documents into a narrative for senators to follow.The other managers followed, each given a specific assignment to discuss certain parts of the case against Mr. Trump, but none with quite the ease and fluidity of Mr. Schiff, who has been Speaker Nancy Pelosi's point man on impeachment since the beginning.He dominated the day as the main presenter, spending more time at the lectern than all six other managers.But Mr. Schiff has also become a lightning rod among Republicans who seethed at what they saw as his self-righteousness and accused him repeatedly of mischaracterizing the evidence. He has become such a favorite villain for Republicans that they use him to rally their side.In some respects, Mr. Schiff and the other House managers are facing the classic challenge for prosecutors, legal specialists said. It is always the government's challenge in a trial to try to establish clarity, while defense teams need only muddy the waters and raise reasonable doubts to win an acquittal. They are also facing a jury that gets to decide for itself what the law means and whether to hear witnesses, and that is hardly made up of neutral people.The details of the broader Ukraine affair -- the monthslong campaign of pressure Mr. Trump and his proxies, including his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, brought on Ukraine's president to announce two investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically -- are complicated things to explain. Mr. Schiff and his colleagues have spent hours dissecting the details to build their case.Mr. Trump's White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, a longtime civil litigator, has been as combative as his client, the president, both in angry letters he signed during the House phase declaring that the executive branch would not participate, and now in person on the Senate floor. He has been joined by Jay Sekulow, Mr. Trump's private lawyer, in leading the White House legal team.While the team's role was to watch the House managers establish their case on Wednesday, Mr. Cipollone made clear on the opening day that his central message would be one of contempt for the House managers' efforts.\"A partisan impeachment is like stealing an election,\" Mr. Cipollone declared, adding: \"It's outrageous. It's outrageous. And the American people won't stand for it, I'll tell you that right now.\"He sat silent all day on Wednesday but demonstrated on Tuesday that he planned to take an aggressive approach not just defending the president but also assailing his accusers.Without much history in this kind of public political confrontations, Mr. Cipollone seemed a little nervous at first but quickly warmed to the task and adopted the relentless attack mode of his boss, his voice at times dripping with disdain over the Democrats he deemed partisan hacks and at one point demanding they apologize.James G. McGovern, a defense lawyer at Hogan Lovells and former federal prosecutor, argued that everyone knows what Mr. Trump did, but that Republicans simply do not believe it was worthy of impeachment. He said the Trump team's tactics reminded him of an analogy from the criminal trial world: the occasional refusal by a jury to refuse to convict a defendant even if the accusations are true.\"It's almost a jury nullification type of defense,\" Mr. McGovern said. \"They want people to make the decision based on fundamental fairness or process. They want Republicans and the people inclined to vote their way to be comfortable with the decision based on some concept of unfairness.\"Against that backdrop, it was striking that in detailing the argument that the process has been fatally unfair, Mr. Cipollone falsely asserted on Tuesday that Republican lawmakers had not been allowed into the secure room where the House Intelligence Committee deposed witnesses last year.In reality, dozens of Republican lawmakers from three committees and their staff lawyers participated in those depositions.Samuel Buell, a Duke University law professor and former federal prosecutor, said the Trump defense bore similarities to the tactic known as putting the government on trial -- trying to get a jury to doubt the prosecutors' case by suggesting the client was a victim of a rush to judgment by incompetent or corrupt law enforcement officials.\"It parallels putting the government on trial in form but not in purpose, because I don't think that there are senators sitting on the fence going, 'I might vote for impeachment but not if I lose confidence in the process Adam Schiff used on the House side,\"' Mr. Buell said. \"This argument is directed at the political arena.\"Mr. Cipollone and his colleagues will get their chance to make their case uninterrupted starting Saturday, although it is possible the White House team may not use all of its allotted 24 hours, meaning it could wrap up by Monday.Mr. Cipollone's task at that point will be to deconstruct the House case that has sunk in over three days, arguing not just that the process has been unfair to the president but also that Democrats are trying to achieve through a trumped-up impeachment process what they cannot at the ballot box.Nicholas Fandos and Peter Baker contributed reporting.Nicholas Fandos and Peter Baker contributed reporting.PhotographAdam Schiff, left, the lead impeachment manager, and Pat A.

Ray, his successor as independent counsel, who negotiated a settlement with Mr. Clinton as he left the White House that included a fine and the suspension of his law license.Mr. Dershowitz, a Harvard Law School professor emeritus who became famous as a defense counsel for high-profile defendants like O.J. Simpson, Claus von Bülow and Mike Tyson, will have a more limited role, presenting oral arguments at the Senate trial \"to address the constitutional arguments against impeachment and removal,\" the legal team said in a statement.In choosing the three prominent lawyers, the president assembled what he regards as an all-star television legal team, enlisting some of his favorite defenders from Fox News. But each of them brings his own baggage. Mr. Dershowitz represented Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted sex offender. Mr. Starr was pushed out as a university president because of his handling of sexual misconduct by the football team. And Mr. Ray was once charged with stalking a former girlfriend.Bringing in Mr. Starr will also invariably supercharge the discussion over Mr. Trump's impeachment by reopening the long-running debate over Mr. Clinton's case. Mr. Starr remains a polarizing figure from that era and every point he makes in favor of Mr. Trump's innocence will invite comparisons to the approach he took to Mr. Clinton.But Mr. Trump evidently sees Mr. Starr as an important validating presence who could endorse the view that the president's impeachment was illegitimate and unfair. The prosecutor whose investigation triggered the last presidential impeachment will now stand up on the floor of the Senate to declare that this impeachment is invalid. And he will explain why, in the view of someone who has been there, these charges do not add up to high crimes.\"President Trump has done nothing wrong and is confident that this team will defend him, the voters, and our democracy from this baseless, illegitimate impeachment,\" the White House said in a statement on Friday night, confirming earlier news reports.For some Republicans who admire Mr. Starr, his participation may carry weight. \"I was encouraged by it,\" Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said of the newly constituted legal team.But Mr. Trump's built-out team -- which will be led by the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, and the president's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow -- faces the dual challenge of preserving the president's support among Republican senators and presenting his case to the wider public watching on television during an election year.As long as Senate Republicans stick with Mr. Trump as expected, the House Democrats prosecuting the case will not be able to muster the two-thirds vote required for conviction. Just as important to the president, though, is framing the debate in a way that he can take onto the campaign trail as he battles Democrats for a second term.This team may not provide the sort of defense the president's most combative supporters feel he needs. Stephen K. Bannon, the president's former chief strategist who has been hosting a daily radio show and podcast on impeachment with a group that often coordinates with the White House, said the addition of Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Starr brought impressive legal power to Mr. Trump's team.But Mr. Bannon expressed concern that \"there are no fire breathers,\" as he put it. \"It's very conventional in its makeup and approach. But this is not playing on C-Span. The senators are not the jury; the American people are the jury. I strongly believe you need some of the fire breathers from the House, like Matt Gaetz, Jim Jordan, Mark Meadows and Lee Zeldin.\"Mr. Trump wanted some of those congressmen, among his most stalwart House Republican allies, to be on the defense team, but Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, rejected the idea. Those House members, who are familiar with the testimony provided by witnesses during the impeachment inquiry, are expected to help behind the scenes and to help defend the president on television, people familiar with the president's legal defense plan said.Mr. Trump's team is also preparing for the possibility that witnesses will be called in the trial, despite Mr. McConnell's hope to avoid it.Other lawyers joining Mr. Trump's trial team include Pam Bondi, the former Florida attorney general who has been a spokeswoman for the defense effort; Jane Serene Raskin, who defended Mr. Trump during the investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III; and Eric D. Herschmann, a partner at the law firm of another of Mr. Trump's longtime lawyers, Marc E. Kasowitz.The president has wanted media-savvy defenders who could play the same vocal role that his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani did during the Mueller investigation. Mr. Dershowitz has been a media figure for years and Mr. Starr was a contributor to Fox News until parting ways with the network because of his new role with Mr. Trump.But the choices were not without controversy, and Republicans on Friday voiced private reservations about some of the lawyers.Mr. Dershowitz has faced questions about his representation of Mr. Epstein, a financier who killed himself in a New York City jail in August. Mr. Dershowitz helped negotiate Mr. Epstein's lenient sentence on sex charges in 2008. Mr. Dershowitz has also been accused of engaging in sex with an underage girl he met through Mr. Epstein; he has denied the claim.Mr. Starr, who helped Mr. Dershowitz on the Epstein defense in 2007, was forced from his job as president of Baylor University in 2016 amid accusations he did not respond to allegations of sexual assault made by women against members of the school's football team.An outside investigation rebuked the university leadership, saying it had \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\" As he left the university presidency, Mr. Starr expressed \"heartfelt contrition for the tragedy and sadness that has unfolded\" and said he was \"profoundly sorry\" to victims who were not treated with the care and support they deserved.As for Mr. Ray, he turned himself in to New York authorities in 2006 in response to a misdemeanor charge of stalking a woman he had previously been dating. The police said he had sent emails and visited the woman against her wishes after she broke off their relationship. A law enforcement official said the case was sealed, suggesting it was most likely dismissed. Mr. Ray declined to comment.Mr. Trump himself has previously questioned Mr. Starr's zealous pursuit of Mr. Clinton. In 1999, after the House voted to impeach the president largely along party lines, Mr. Trump told interviewers that Mr. Starr was a \"wacko\" and a \"lunatic.\" But more recently, he is said to have enjoyed watching him on television. Mr. Starr declined to comment on Friday.Mr. Trump faces two articles of impeachment accusing him of abusing his office by pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his Democratic rivals and obstructing Congress by refusing to provide documents or permit testimony during the House inquiry.During his television appearances, Mr. Starr has argued that the articles of impeachment passed by the House largely along party lines were \"woefully inadequate\" to justify removing a president from office. He has contrasted that with his investigation into Mr. Clinton, where the president was accused of felonies for trying to cover up his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, a onetime White House intern, during a sexual harassment lawsuit.In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Dershowitz said he expected his sole role to be arguing on behalf of Mr. Trump before the Senate next Friday, making points he had made in writing and on television.He said that he \"worried about the precedent\" set by the two articles of impeachment, which he described as \"too vague and open-ended,\" and absent \"high crimes and misdemeanors.\"The statement announcing his appointment described Mr. Dershowitz as \"nonpartisan when it comes to the Constitution,\" having opposed the impeachment of Mr. Clinton and voted for Hillary Clinton. \"He is participating in this impeachment trial to defend the integrity of the Constitution and to prevent the creation of a dangerous constitutional precedent,\" the statement said.The return of Mr. Starr to the impeachment stage was an astonishing development for many veterans of the battle two decades ago. Ms. Lewinsky expressed her disbelief on Twitter on Friday, writing, \"this is definitely an 'are you kidding me?' kinda day\" with an expletive before the word \"kidding.\"Annie Karni contributed reporting.PhotographKen Starr, whose report led to Bill Clinton's impeachment.

Bloomberg's campaign will air a 60-second ad promoting his record on gun control, while President Trump has lined up a commercial celebrating his time in office.DES MOINES -- Two billionaires will pitch their presidential candidacies amid the beer and car commercials of the Super Bowl on Sunday, with Michael R. Bloomberg spending a full minute addressing gun violence and President Trump using 30 seconds to highlight his first years in office.The Bloomberg ad, which his campaign says it hopes will \"stop people in their tracks,\" features an emotional story told by a mother still grieving the loss of her son, shown onscreen in youth football gear, who was killed by gunfire at the age of 20. She points to Mr. Bloomberg's record on seeking tougher gun laws as the reason she now has \"a dog in the fight\" for the presidency.By contrast, Mr. Trump's ad features relatively general themes and imagery of the president's rallies, with a narrator boasting about low unemployment and the military. The ad could be mistaken as a generic Trump campaign ad; it is not particularly yoked to the football game, nor does it contain the sort of creative or conceptual touches that distinguish expensive Super Bowl ads.Yet with the president's flair for dramatics and the suspense of a great reveal, the Trump campaign said that it would be airing two different 30-second ads during the game, and that the second ad \"will be seen by the world for the first time when it actually airs.\"The dueling presidential ads, which the campaigns revealed Thursday, are as much a contrast in substance -- the Trump ad celebrates a \"safer\" America while the Bloomberg ad points to children killed by gun violence -- as they are a show of financial might and messaging power.And they provide further evidence that the 2020 election will be a yearlong brawl on the national airwaves, with well-financed candidates like Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump exploiting their vast resources to reach huge audiences. Never before have two presidential candidates aired national ads during the Super Bowl.Both campaigns spent $11 million for 60 seconds in front of what is regularly the largest television audience of the year (predictions for this year's Super Bowl, which will be broadcast on Fox, hover around 100 million viewers).Despite its eight-figure sticker price, Mr. Bloomberg's ad is a relatively small slice of his relentless national advertising strategy: He has already spent $275 million of his multibillion-dollar fortune on television, radio and digital media.His campaign has spent roughly $90 million on television ads that feature some attack on Mr. Trump, but, notably, the Super Bowl ad does not even mention the president.Instead, it opens with Calandrian Kemp sharing the story of her son, George Kemp Jr., as the camera pans across childhood pictures of George in football gear. He was shot and killed in 2013 during an altercation while he was at mechanic school; he was 20.\"I just kept saying, you cannot tell me that the child I gave birth to is no longer here,\" Ms. Kemp says in the ad, her voice breaking. The screen then shows white text on a black background: \"2,900 children die from gun violence every year.\"That figure has been cited by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group primarily financed by Mr. Bloomberg.Ms. Kemp then praises Mr. Bloomberg's record on gun control. \"I know Mike is not afraid of the gun lobby -- they're scared of him,\" she says. \"And they should be.\"The ad is scheduled to air between the end of the Super Bowl halftime show and the beginning of the third quarter, the campaign said.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]In the age of data-driven, targeted advertising, spending so much on a single ad to reach such a broad audience may seem wasteful. But Howard Wolfson, a top adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said the thought behind buying an ad during the Super Bowl was simple: It will reach the largest available audience, and Super Bowl ads are often talked about well after the game.\"It's a time when people get together and they sit down and they watch the Super Bowl, but they also know that there are these ads and there's a lot of conversation about the ads,\" Mr. Wolfson said. \"It's a very wide net, it's a broad swath of Americans, and this is an issue that there's been an awful lot of agreement on.\"The campaign said it had selected an ad about gun violence for the Super Bowl slot because it was an issue \"central to Mike Bloomberg.\" Indeed, Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, made the final call. When shown a variety of ads to choose from, Mr. Bloomberg was \"adamant\" that the campaign run the one featuring Ms. Kemp.\"I cried the first time I saw it,\" Mr. Wolfson said. \"Other people who saw it in the office cried. There are a lot of fairly hard-bitten political people here.\"Mr. Trump's ad begins with a news report from Mr. Trump's favorite night -- election night 2016 -- as a narrator intones that \"America demanded change, and change is what we got.\"Quick flashes of military operations -- an aircraft carrier cutting through choppy seas, a fighter jet making a hard banking turn -- give way to a recited list of economic realities under Mr. Trump: rising wages and low unemployment.At the end of the ad, Mr. Trump is shown speaking at one of his raucous rallies, proclaiming, \"Ladies and gentlemen, the best is yet to come.\"[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Bloomberg have shown a propensity for advertising during sporting events, which are some of the rare broadcasts that still capture live audiences in an age of digital streaming platforms. Mr. Bloomberg's campaign ran ads throughout the N.F.L. playoffs, and Mr. Trump advertised during the World Series last year.Mr. Bloomberg is not competing in the Iowa caucuses, which will take place the night after the Super Bowl, nor has he mounted a concerted effort in New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, which also vote in February. He is instead focusing on the 14 states that vote on Super Tuesday, March 3, when about 40 percent of the Democratic delegates will be allocated.By flooding the airwaves across the country, Mr. Bloomberg is betting he can drown out his Democratic rivals, who are still focused on campaigning in the early-voting states. The advertising blitz has helped him move up to 7 percent support in the latest New York Times national polling average, good enough for fifth place.Of course, seeing two political ads in a night that is built on entertainment could turn off some viewers. But Mr. Bloomberg's advisers said they were not concerned about running an emotional ad about a divisive issue amid the other, often humorous commercials.\"I think it's going to stop people in their tracks,\" Mr. Wolfson said. \"Frankly, amid the dancing raisins and souped-up cars, a mother speaking fundamental and powerful truths about her experience and her son's loss will draw an awful lot of attention, deservedly so.\"PhotographBoth Michael R. Bloomberg, above, and President Trump will air ads during Sunday's game, a first for two presidential candidates.

He attacked what he called \"failed\" open-border policies in Germany, which has resettled hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees, and criticized Berlin's stances on Iran, military spending and Chinese investment in global telephone networks. He also expressed an eagerness to empower conservatives throughout Europe.\"I absolutely want to empower other conservatives throughout Europe, other leaders,\" Mr. Grenell told Breitbart, a far-right website, in an interview shortly after his arrival in Germany. \"I think there is a groundswell of conservative policies that are taking hold because of the failed policies of the left.\"While intelligence directors have tried to serve as neutral arbiters of facts, Mr. Grenell's experience as an ideological advocate prompted some former officials to express concern that he could color the intelligence he presents to Mr. Trump rather than present an objective assessment.\"This is a job requiring leadership, management, substance and secrecy,\" said John Sipher, a former C.I.A. officer. \"He doesn't have the kind of background and experience we would expect for such a critical position.\"Mr. Grenell is expected to keep his current ambassadorship as long as he is acting intelligence director, one administration official said. Mr. Grenell did not respond to a request for comment.His bare-knuckled approach clearly resonates with the president and his inner circle. Last spring, shortly before the now-infamous removal of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, Mr. Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., invoked Mr. Grenell in a tweet about conservative discontent with Ms. Yovanovitch. \"We need more @RichardGrenell's and less of these jokers as ambassadors,\" the younger Mr. Trump wrote.Mr. Grenell, who has pushed to advance gay rights in his current post, is also thought to be the first openly gay cabinet member.Republican senators had privately pushed the Trump administration to nominate a national security professional for the post, and advisers made clear that the president was not nominating Mr. Grenell for the permanent job. Mr. Trump has installed acting leaders in other top government vacancies, giving him freedom to maneuver around the demands of Senate confirmation.By law, the current acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has to give up his temporary role before March 12. Mr. Grenell is expected to begin his new job on Thursday. Mr. Maguire, in a statement on Wednesday, thanked Mr. Trump and said that when he was confirmed by the Senate to lead the counterterrorism center, he \"never imagined what would follow.\"Mr. Trump can choose any Senate-confirmed official to replace Mr. Maguire, who has served as the acting director of national intelligence since the resignation last summer of Dan Coats, a former Republican senator from Indiana. Mr. Grenell was confirmed by the Senate for his current job after a delay caused by parliamentary tactics that stirred a bipartisan outcry.He would be the latest in a line of intelligence directors who have had varied policy experience including diplomatic or military backgrounds rather than stints in the intelligence world.But Mr. Grenell is also an acerbic combatant who throws regular punches at \"fake news\" reporters and Mr. Trump's opponents online. Last month, he angrily demanded The Washington Post retract a report, which he insisted was based on fabricated sources, that Mr. Trump had threatened to impose auto tariffs on European cars if European leaders did not adopt a tougher line on Iran's nuclear program. The next day, Germany's defense minister publicly confirmed it.Mr. Grenell honed his combative style when he worked as a spokesman at the United Nations for the former ambassador John R. Bolton. Often to the surprise -- and sometimes the horror -- of the State Department's more staid communications officials who worked for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Grenell would take on reporters and argue long into the night about stories appearing in major newspapers and on television.In recent days, after Attorney General William P. Barr said in an interview that Mr. Trump's tweets made his job more difficult, Mr. Grenell appeared on Fox News to counter that view. \"It makes my job so much easier,\" Mr. Grenell said, offering the example of Mr. Trump's pressure on NATO allies to spend more on defense.In a country where former President Barack Obama is still widely popular, Mr. Grenell's style put off other officials and ultimately isolated him, the German publication Der Spiegel reported last year. \"The powerful avoid him,\" the newsmagazine wrote. \"Doors have been shut.\"Much of Mr. Grenell's criticism has been directed at German military spending, its decision to stand behind the nuclear deal with Iran and its wavering on the American demand to ban Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, from building next-generation mobile networks.He has also had successes, including getting Germany to agree to take American liquefied natural gas and to pull the landing rights of an Iranian airline. A number of German companies have pulled out of Iran, warned by Mr. Grenell that they could run afoul of American sanctions if they did business with Tehran.And while German military spending has continued to rise during the Trump administration, the government in Berlin has ratcheted back its goals for increasing spending.While most of the previous directors of national intelligence have tried to take a nonpartisan tone, Mr. Trump has looked askance at officials who have tried to remain neutral. He has increasingly looked to people for positions who he believes share his views.\"Grenell, from the beginning, was an ultraright-wing sniper on social media,\" said Douglas H. Wise, a former senior intelligence official. \"He is certainly in line with the Trump agenda.\"Intelligence professionals reacted with surprise, and some with disappointment, questioning Mr. Grenell's experience and temperament. The appointment demonstrated that Mr. Trump little understands or values the intelligence community, said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center.\"Personal loyalty is prized above relevant experience and demonstrated competence,\" said Mr. Rasmussen, now the acting executive director of the McCain Institute. \"Professionalism and integrity are devalued. The signal this sends to our career national security and intelligence professionals is unmistakable.\"Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia and the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Mr. Trump for appointing another acting director, rather than choosing an official nominee, \"apparently in an effort to side step the Senate's constitutional authority.\"While it has never been clear how Mr. Trump viewed Mr. Maguire, there is little doubt that the president would prefer a partisan fighter in the post. Mr. Maguire, a retired admiral, became the acting director in August just as a whistle-blower inside the C.I.A. filed a complaint about Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine.Since even before the acquittal of Mr. Trump in the Senate impeachment trial, the president has been pushing to remove officials seen as disloyal to or undermining of the president or holding views contrary to the White House, looking for replacements who are more likely to follow the president's wishes.Mr. Trump has at times disparaged American intelligence agencies because he did not agree with their findings, perhaps chiefly the conclusion that Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election to help him win. He told his intelligence chiefs to \"go back to school\" after they offered assessments on Iran and North Korea at odds with his policy initiatives.Anxious to avoid a repeat, Mr. Maguire's aides initially pushed for this year's public hearing to be canceled, a request that lawmakers have rejected.Tensions between the White House and intelligence agencies only grew during the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Maguire initially blocked the whistle-blower complaint from being forwarded to Congress, following the guidance of administration lawyers. But he eventually helped broker the agreement to provide the complaint to Congress's intelligence committees, allowing the impeachment inquiry to gain steam.When Mr. Coats announced his resignation in July, Mr. Trump initially nominated a Republican ally in Congress, Representative John Ratcliffe of Texas, to be the next top intelligence chief, a job considered to be among the most nonpartisan in Washington. But Mr. Trump quickly dropped those plans after pushback from Democrats and some key Republicans who worried Mr. Ratcliffe's loyalty to the president and lack of intelligence experience would make him nearly impossible to confirm. There were also concerns that Mr. Ratcliffe exaggerated some of what he included on his résumé.After Mr. Ratcliffe was dropped from consideration, Mr. Trump promised to announce a new nominee soon. But the list of people with the requisite experience who have not been critical of the president is slim.The administration considered, and discarded, a number of potential nominees, including Pete Hoekstra, the American ambassador to the Netherlands and a former Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Representative Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican on the committee.Julian E.

But Mr. Benioff, a tech mogul and environmental philanthropist, felt sure he had found a climate change solution that even President Trump could love: Planting trees.Never mind that the idea came from former Vice President Al Gore, who has demanded Mr. Trump's resignation over his energy policies. Never mind that Mr. Trump has begun the yearlong process of withdrawing America from the Paris Agreement on climate change, mocked Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist, and worked to eliminate every regulation aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions.The idea of planting one trillion trees had one enormous political advantage: It was practically sacrifice-free, no war on coal, no transition from fossil fuels, no energy conservation or investment in renewable sources of power that Mr. Trump loves to mock, like the windmills that cause cancer or the solar panels that are not \"strong enough.\"\"I just knew this is a really good idea. I said I will pitch it and see what happens,\" Mr. Benioff said. \"Even my chief of staff said to me, 'You're not going.\"'How the trillion trees initiative migrated from Mr. Benioff's PowerPoint presentations to the president's pronouncements, first at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month, then his State of the Union address last week, is a study in ad hoc policymaking at the Trump White House. A personal appeal from a celebrity voice got the idea past traditional gatekeepers. A back channel through Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, gave it life, and a re-election campaign that has sought to soften some of Mr. Trump's sharper edges ensured its publicity.It is far from clear that the United States government will actually plant any trees, or that a trillion trees would do much in the near term to stop the worst effects of planetary warming. Tom Crowther, an environmental scientist and an author of the study that sparked the movement, cautioned that the full benefits would not be seen for about 100 years, when most of the new trees would reach full maturity. During that time, he said, the world needs to drive down fossil fuel emissions.\"If tree planting is just used as an excuse to avoid cutting greenhouse gas emissions or to further limit environmental protection, then it could be a real disaster,\" said Dr. Crowther, who studies ecosystem ecology at ETH Zurich.But such details might be beside the point for a White House initiative that is heavier on politics than science. One senior administration official described the tree initiative as one the president believes will \"bring people together.\"\"We're committed to conserving the majesty of God's creation and the natural beauty of our world,\" Mr. Trump told investors and world leaders in Davos.Despite his longstanding antagonism toward climate science, Mr. Trump in recent months has struck a softer tone on the topic. In a meeting with President Emmanuel Macron of France in December, he said climate change was \"very important\" to him. He recently denied the undeniable fact that he ever declared global warming a hoax.He even said he was reading a book on the topic. (The book, according to the White House, was, \"Donald J. Trump: An Environmental Hero\" by Ed Russo, a former consultant to the president).The president's commitment to a global effort to plant one trillion trees by 2030 surprised even White House officials who work on environment policy. Mr. Trump never uttered the phrase \"climate change\" in his pledge. He described it instead as a plan \"to protect the environment.\"Yet the science behind it is centered on planetary warming. As trees grow, they absorb the carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change. According to researchers at ETH Zurich, worldwide reforestation with 1.2 trillion trees could reduce atmospheric carbon in the atmosphere by about 25 percent.And with polls showing many young Republicans breaking with their party on climate change, political strategists described the initiative as part of an effort to steer Mr. Trump toward more environmentally friendly messaging without abandoning the development of more planet-warming fossil fuel energy.\"It's obvious the president's team understands this is a weakness for him right now given the rhetoric he's used, the dismissal of climate science and all of the executive actions that are consistent with that rhetoric,\" said Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican congressman from Florida who championed a carbon tax when he was in office.The shift is happening across the Republican Party, which has inched over decades from denying the existence of climate change to saying it was part of a natural cycle to dismissing it as unstoppable to considering modest policy responses. On Wednesday, House Republicans introduced a package of climate change legislation that would fund the capture and storage of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel plants, research new ways to use and commercialize the captured carbon, and conserve the environment by, for instance, planting trees.\"Trees aren't the only solution to addressing the climate issue, but I'll say they are by far one of the best solutions,\" said Representative Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican who is developing legislation to bring the United States into the trillion tree plan.\"It's a big goal to plant a trillion trees globally, but I think the world needs a big solution,\" Mr. Westerman, a Yale-educated engineer and forester, said.It remains unclear what the Trump administration is committing to do in joining the trillion tree plan. While one senior administration official said this week that the White House was busy preparing a tree-planting target, another noted that the $4.8 trillion budget issued Tuesday did not mention the plan.This is not the first time a back channel has been used to let a big name promote the climate cause. During Mr. Trump's presidential transition, Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, brought Mr. Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio to Trump Tower to press for action on climate change -- to no avail.Those who deny the established science of climate change are confident Mr. Trump's heart is with them. They point to another part of his speech in Davos, in which he railed against the \"prophets of doom\" who warn of climate catastrophes.\"Donald Trump is as militant against the climate hysteria as ever,\" said Steven J. Milloy, a member of Mr. Trump's transition team who runs a website promoting the false theories that climate change alternately isn't real or harmful.Mr. Benioff, in a telephone interview, said he decided to take a chance anyway. Mr. Gore had bent his ear last summer about emerging research into reforestation and climate change. After discussions with scientists at the Benioff Ocean Initiative, a program at the University of California, Santa Barbara, he was hooked.\"I realized this looks like a practical, actionable thing,\" he said.He discussed it with other scientists, such as Jane Goodall, the English primatologist, as well as financiers, hoping to rally governments and companies around the initiative at the World Economic Forum.Mr. Benioff has known Mr. Kushner since before Mr. Trump took office and has worked with Ivanka Trump on issues like job training. He traveled to Washington to discuss the tree initiative with Mr. Kushner in October.\"People think something that's actually not true, which is that they're not interested in hearing new ideas or hearing science,\" Mr. Benioff said of the Trump administration.\"Trees are the ultimate bipartisan issue,\" he added. \"Everyone is pro-tree.\"Mr. Gore applauded Mr. Benioff for getting the issue on President Trump's radar. \"I would not have expected him to have any success on that,\" he said in an interview.But he was skeptical. \"I don't have any trust in the Trump administration's approach to climate because no one can be deemed as serious on the climate crisis unless they're in favor of emission reductions,\" he said.Dr. Crowther was more optimistic. Speaking from a camper in the Moroccan desert where he half-joked he had gone to escape the attention his work has spurred, he said, \"If restoration can be socially and ecologically responsible, I think it poses a really exciting opportunity for bipartisan leadership.\"Mr. Curbelo, the rare Republican politician who has embraced a politically difficult response to climate change, conceded that tree planting and carbon capture programs were modest at best, and both parties would need to negotiate ambitious emissions cuts.\"However,\" he added, \"that was impossible when Republicans weren't even at the table.\"For more climate news sign up for the Climate Fwd: newsletter or follow @NYTClimate on Twitter .PhotographMarc Benioff at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where President Trump embraced his Trillion Trees plan.

So he is focusing on what constitutes a fair trial -- and trying to put Republicans in a box.WASHINGTON -- Senator Chuck Schumer had a pointed warning when John R. Bolton declared himself willing to testify in President Trump's impeachment trial: Republicans who refused Democrats' demands for witnesses and documents would be \"participating in a cover-up.\"For Mr. Schumer, the voluble New York Democrat and minority leader, the resurfacing of Mr. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, as a potential witness was a way to squeeze vulnerable Republicans like Senator Susan Collins of Maine to cross party lines and effectively give him control of the floor during a historic trial over whether to remove Mr. Trump. But Ms. Collins, who is a top Democratic target facing a tough re-election in November, quickly made it known she did not find Mr. Schumer's tactics persuasive.\"I don't think Chuck Schumer is very interested in my opinion,\" she told reporters in the Capitol. \"I don't think he's really very interested in doing anything but trying to defeat me by telling lies to the people of Maine. And you can quote me on that.\"Ms. Collins's sharp retort illustrates Mr. Schumer's core challenge as the Senate, likely this week, convenes only the third impeachment trial of a sitting president in American history. As leader of the opposition, he must hold together Senate Democrats (including five who are running for president) while securing the cooperation of some of the very same Republicans he is working to defeat.For Mr. Schumer, who has spent three years as the Senate's top Democrat in the shadow of his House counterpart, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump is both an opportunity and a risk.It is no secret in the capital that the job Mr. Schumer really wants is that of Senate majority leader -- a post he thought would be his with Hillary Clinton in the White House, before Mr. Trump's 2016 victory unleashed a political earthquake. A schmoozer and a deal-maker, he is more suited to the politics of getting things done than to the partisan knife-fighting culture of Mr. Trump's Washington.\"I think it's very hard for him to be the leader of a resistance,\" said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, a progressive strategist and aide for Mr. Schumer's predecessor, Harry Reid. \"The weekend that millions of women took to the streets to protest Trump, Schumer went to the Women's March, and the next day had a press conference on the size of overhead bins on airplanes. The world was falling apart, but Chuck Schumer was still doing his Sunday press conferences.\"Over the past few weeks, as Ms. Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, engaged in a bitter standoff in recent weeks over the shape of the trial -- the speaker refused to send the articles, while Mr. McConnell refused to commit to hearing any new evidence in the Senate -- Mr. Schumer was still pushing daily for a deal with Republicans to hear from witnesses and secure more documents.Mr. Schumer lost that round, when Mr. McConnell announced last week that he had the votes lined up to move ahead with the trial without committing to either. Now, the Democratic leader faces a more consequential set of tests once the trial gets underway. Mr. Schumer said he plans to force a series of votes on calling witnesses and hearing new evidence, pressuring Republicans to join the call for more information or be tagged as complicit in what Democrats have branded presidential obstruction.There is some evidence the strategy is working: On Friday, Ms. Collins said she was working with a \"fairly small group of Republicans\" to ensure that witnesses could be called.The Senate math is not in Mr. Schumer's favor. With 47 senators caucusing with the Democrats (including two independents who routinely vote with them), he is still four shy of the 51 votes he would need to force subpoenas for witnesses and documents. While it appears that Ms. Collins and two other Republicans -- Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah -- might be persuaded to go along in voting to hear from Mr. Bolton and others, Mr. Schumer was hard pressed to name a fourth vote.\"There are people vulnerable politically. There are people who have a conscience,\" he said in an interview. \"There are people who are retiring. There are people who might have some beef. Who knows? I will tell you this: I talk to Republicans all the time, and they're upset by this president.\"In the end, Mr. Schumer knows there is almost no chance the Republican-led Senate will convict Mr. Trump for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, a move that would take two-thirds of senators, or 67. But the focus on what constitutes a fair trial, he argued, will either succeed in unearthing new information about Mr. Trump, or at least help Democrats pick up seats in 2020.\"It's a win-win,\" he said, describing his strategy, though he quickly corrected himself, settling on \"no lose\" as a better frame. If Republicans block new evidence, Democrats will deem the trial \"illegitimate and a sham,\" he said, adding, \"Pursuing witnesses and documents makes us better off, no matter the outcome.\"The position is at odds with the one Mr. Schumer took almost exactly 21 years ago, when he opposed calling witnesses during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. (Mr. Schumer likes to recount his status as, in his own words, a \"historical footnote\": the only member of Congress to have voted three times against Mr. Clinton's impeachment -- twice as a House member in 1998, first in the Judiciary Committee and then on the floor, and again after winning election to the Senate.)Mr. Schumer argued that there was no contradiction. Unlike the witnesses he is seeking against Mr. Trump -- including Mr. Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff -- the Clinton witnesses had already testified, so there was not necessarily anything new to be learned from them. By contrast, Mr. Trump directed a blanket stonewall of the House impeachment inquiry, refusing to provide any documents or allow White House officials to testify.Republicans, however, howl that he is being hypocritical. They say Mr. Schumer is engaged in a transparent bid to play politics with the most sacred of senatorial duties. As to whether he will get four Republicans on board on key questions of how the trial should unfold, Senator John Kennedy, the Louisiana Republican known for his folksy quips, said: \"When donkeys fly.\"But Senator Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, said Mr. Schumer had \"played the hand he has very well.\"\"There's a reason President Trump and Mitch McConnell are deathly afraid of having key witnesses, because it can change the dynamics of a trial,\" Mr. Van Hollen said. \"And the flip side of that is that if Republicans vote to block key witnesses and evidence, it will expose the trial as a fraud.\"At 69, Mr. Schumer has spent his entire adult life in politics. The son of a Brooklyn exterminator and a homemaker, he caught the politics bug in 1968 as a Harvard undergraduate campaigning for Eugene McCarthy, and disappointed his parents by running for the New York State Assembly at 23, fresh out of Harvard Law. (At his mother's insistence, he took the bar exam, but he never practiced.)He won that race and every race since, winning election to the House in 1980, the Senate in 1998 after a hard-fought campaign in which his opponent, the incumbent Republican senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, memorably called him \"a putzhead\" -- a Yiddish insult that was a bridge too far for New York voters.With his familiar Brooklyn accent and half-moon glasses perched on the downslope of his nose, Mr. Schumer has long been an upbeat, if publicity-hungry, figure in the Capitol, giving rise to the well-worn joke that there is no place in Washington more dangerous than between him and a camera.Naturally gregarious, Mr. Schumer loves legislating -- he once briefly contemplated running for governor but decided against it -- and retail politics. He visits each of New York's 62 counties once a year, can tick off Long Island high schools by name and knows the best place in Buffalo for a \"beef on weck\" sandwich.There is a little bit of Senator Pothole in him. His political modus operandi is as follows: Fix someone's problem (any problem, doesn't matter what, so long as it helps the middle class), and then hold a Sunday morning news conference in New York to talk about it. He has done all this while raising millions of dollars from his hometown industry -- Wall Street -- prompting criticism that he is a corporate politician, out of step with the rising Democratic left.To say he is a hands-on leader would be an understatement; when his 96-year-old father was rushed to the hospital with an acute attack of gallstones a few Saturdays ago, Mr. Schumer was dialing up colleagues on his flip phone to give them advice about Sunday morning talk show appearances. But his close friends say he never had a grand plan to rise up the ranks.\"There was no long term strategy: I'm going to wait X years in the House and then I'm going to the Senate,\" said Carol Kellermann, who has known Mr. Schumer for 50 years, since their days at Harvard, and later was his chief of staff. Still, she added, \"I think he wishes that he would be the majority leader. That would be a capstone of all the legislative work he has done.\"Mr. Trump's election in 2016 left the ordinarily cheery Mr. Schumer moping around his Brooklyn apartment. But the New York senator, who is Jewish, said he soon had \"an epiphany, a message from the heavens, if you will, because I believe in God.\"\"Chuck, stop moping,\" he said he told himself. \"Had Hillary been president and you in the majority, the job would have been easier, more fun, and you would have gotten good things done, which is why you're here. But with Trump as president and you as minority leader, your job is much more important.\"PhotographSenator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, is trying to hold Democrats together while securing the cooperation of the Republicans he is working to defeat.

As a teenager, the future federal prosecutor confused \"reverse\" and \"drive\" on a borrowed stick-shift car and plowed through the window of a hearing-aid shop in Carbondale, Ill., where the proprietor had to yank an older customer to safety.\"My daughter told him he could drive, but what he did not say was that he didn't know how,\" said Mary Koster, whose Chevette hurtled through the window that day.The accident is an apt metaphor for Mr. Ratcliffe's recent political trajectory, in which he has ridden light experience and a flair for at-times reckless braggadocio to become President Trump's nominee to be America's top spy, the director of national intelligence.Mr. Ratcliffe gunned for the job last July, slammed on the brakes, but is back in drive, with Mr. Trump giving senators a choice: confirm a nominee they objected to last summer or accept an equally contentious candidate, the acting director Richard Grenell, for at least the rest of the year.Both men are thinly experienced, combative Trump loyalists who raise concerns about bringing political bias to a sensitive role guiding 17 intelligence agencies. In the 2000s, Mr. Ratcliffe was an appointee of President George W. Bush to the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Texas, where he led an antiterrorism unit. The last time Mr. Trump floated his name for the job, he abruptly pulled the plug after it emerged that Mr. Ratcliffe had overstated his counterterrorism experience.Mr. Grenell, who also serves as Mr. Trump's ambassador to Germany and was previously a U.S. spokesman at the United Nations, has already taken action at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, freezing hiring and initiating a review intended to shrink the office.Lawmakers are divided. Some want a quick Senate confirmation vote on Mr. Ratcliffe, who would in theory be more accountable to congressional oversight committees. Others in Congress say Mr. Grenell possesses more intelligence heft, having spent years immersed in national security issues.By contrast, they say, Mr. Ratcliffe has done relatively little to augment his thin experience. As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, he has a reputation for absenteeism and lackluster interest in complicated intelligence issues, preferring loud defenses of Mr. Trump's foreign policy stances.Mr. Ratcliffe's allies say he possesses personal qualities that would offset his lack of experience, and that it is difficult to discern how much antiterrorism experience he had as a prosecutor, because some records are classified.\"He's a good listener, always well-grounded in law and the principles that undergird democracy and the Justice Department,\" John D. Ashcroft, attorney general in the George W. Bush administration and a former Ratcliffe law partner, said in an interview. \"These are personality traits and characteristics that would serve him extremely well.\"Telegenic, with a fraternity president demeanor, Mr. Ratcliffe grew up in Chicago's northwest suburbs, the youngest of six children born to educators. In 1977, his father, Robert, took a job as a dean at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. Mr. Ratcliffe worked as a golf caddy in summer and went to the University of Notre Dame, where he was on the golf team and graduated in three years. He received his law degree from Southern Methodist University near Dallas, where he met his wife, Michele, a native of Detroit and a former federal prosecutor now in private practice.The Ratcliffes and their two daughters live on a golf course in Heath, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. During the eight years he worked for the Justice Department Mr. Ratcliffe served simultaneously as Heath's mayor, an unpaid, nonpartisan job that was his first elected office.It was in the mayor's office that he said he got valuable experience for his U.S. attorney post. \"I've really enjoyed my public service work as the mayor of the city of Heath,\" Mr. Ratcliffe said, acknowledging he had no law enforcement experience when he got the position at the U.S. attorney's office.He was working as a corporate lawyer in Dallas when Mr. Bush named him assistant U.S. attorney and chief of antiterrorism and national security for the Eastern District of Texas.Mr. Ratcliffe told a Texas reporter the new job \"would provide me an opportunity to expand my public service into issues of national security.\"In an interview, Ms. Ratcliffe said news stories about Mr. Ratcliffe's lack of terrorism-related experience in those years were at times \"downright wrong.\"\"He has experience I don't even know about,\" she said. \"We've been married for 30 years, and I know there's some things he cannot talk about.\"Arnold Spencer, a former prosecutor who reported to Mr. Ratcliffe in the U.S. attorney's office, said the office handled about 1,500 cases a year, roughly half of them involving guns and drugs, up to one quarter immigration-related, about one-fifth white collar crimes.He said he can't discuss some terrorism-related cases because they are classified. But of those that are public, \"I don't remember anything of national prominence. They were mostly garden-variety laundering schemes distantly related to terror financing.\"But Mr. Spencer said that was beside the point.\"I would much rather have somebody who has John's level of thoughtfulness and intelligence and commitment to carrying out our best interests in an ethical, proactive way than have someone who spent 24 hours a day for 30 or 40 years on national security issues who doesn't have those characteristics,\" Mr. Spencer said.In July, Mr. Ratcliffe's teased nomination foundered after it emerged that he had said during his 2016 campaign and on his website that he tried suspects in a high-profile terrorism financing case. In fact he investigated side issues related to an initial mistrial that he did not prosecute. He did not handle a successful second trial either.The case, United States v. Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, was one of the government's most prominent efforts to shut down funding of terrorist organizations in the decade after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. A Muslim charity had been sending money to Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. But Mr. Ratcliffe played no part in the substance of the case, which was prosecuted in a different district, said three former government lawyers and a former senior F.B.I. official directly involved.Mr. Ratcliffe has worked to correct his inflated claims, including deleting a 2015 news release on his House website that said \"he convicted individuals funneling money to Hamas,\" and a line from another part of the website stating that he \"put terrorists in prison.\"Mr. Ratcliffe served as interim U.S. attorney for Texas's Eastern District for less than year, between the departure of one presidential appointee in 2007 and the arrival of another.In 2008, he coordinated an immigration raid on Pilgrim's Pride, a chicken processor, in which 280 foreign nationals were arrested at plants in five states. During his 2016 congressional campaign, he said, \"I am opposed to amnesty -- period. But don't just take my word on it. Ask any of the over 300 illegal aliens I arrested in a single day.\"In fact, 45 foreign nationals were arrested at the Pilgrim's Pride plant in Texas that day, according to local news reports, by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.After President Barack Obama took office in 2009, Mr. Ratcliffe joined Mr. Ashcroft to form Ashcroft Sutton & Ratcliffe, a law firm working on corporate governance and regulatory issues.In 2014, Mr. Ratcliffe mounted a successful primary challenge for the House seat held by a 91-year-old fellow Republican, Ralph Hall. Though Mr. Ratcliffe initially ran as a Tea Party deficit hawk, Mr. Trump won 76 percent of his district, and he followed the president's lead as the federal deficit surged.\"I don't have a whole lot of experience walking into the Oval Office and negotiating with a president,\" Mr. Ratcliffe told The Dallas Morning News, after a White House meeting with Mr. Trump about efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \"This is why I ran for Congress. I wanted a seat at the table on the national and international issues of the day.\"Mr. Trump initially said he wanted Mr. Ratcliffe for the intelligence job after he impressed the president by berating the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III for five minutes on live television.\"You managed to violate every principle and the most sacred of traditions about prosecutors not offering extra prosecutorial analysis about potential crimes that aren't charged,\" Mr. Ratcliffe told Mr. Mueller, a former F.B.I. director, theatrically slamming the Mueller report onto the table.But Mr. Ratcliffe has one of the worst attendance records on the intelligence committee, attending only about half of its closed-door proceedings, according to people familiar with the matter. He missed a contentious classified briefing on 2020 election security in February, when panel members grilled intelligence officers on Russian interference. When the panel held a closed-door hearing on the classified intelligence budget, Mr. Ratcliffe dipped in for just a few minutes and asked no questions. His defenders note that, as one of the few members who has sat on four committees, he often has conflicts.The White House has grown skeptical of some of the analysis coming from the intelligence community, believing \"a few bad apples\" inject political bias and manipulate reports to undermine the president or his policies, according to one intelligence official. Mr. Trump wants an intelligence director who will root these officers out. Mr. Ratcliffe also believes intelligence has become politicized.But to many current and former intelligence officers, the administration's effort to depoliticize the office amounts to exactly the opposite. Some former intelligence officers bristle at suggestions that political opinion shapes intelligence analysis.Some intelligence officials believe facts and nuanced assessments are falling prey to partisanship, with the Trump administration and its congressional allies eager to play down Russian interference in the 2020 election, for example, and congressional Democrats keen to highlight Moscow's influence operations.A partisan intelligence director, whether Mr. Ratcliffe or Mr. Grenell, heightens those concerns. Douglas H. Wise, a retired C.I.A. senior officer, said by nominating Mr. Ratcliffe, the president had \"clearly prioritized unwavering political loyalty\" over deep intelligence experience.\"Trump depends on that brand of loyalty because he can't manage the agencies by himself,\" Mr. Wise said. \"He must have a loyal consigliere to keep the intelligence community agency heads in line and be the firewall between himself and inconvenient intelligence.\"Kitty Bennett contributed research.PhotographRepresentative John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, was again nominated by President Trump to be director of national intelligence.

Its main focus now is a global pandemic.Kerrie Aistrop, a 39-year-old mother of two, and her fellow moms exchange death-toll updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, thought-provoking tweets and a bit of gallows humor. \"After seeing how the public panics over coronavirus, I can see why the government would never tell us about Aliens,\" reads one shared post.As people in the group have taken an all-or-nothing approach to the virus, either stocking up on toilet paper or writing the epidemic off entirely, Ms. Aistrop, a Republican and pharmaceutical sales representative, has struggled to find a middle ground for news on the ongoing crisis. And so she is relying on her go-to trusted source: President Trump.Unlike many in the G.O.P., Ms. Aistrop doesn't wholly subscribe to the notion of the mainstream news media being out to antagonize the president. When her town's state House G.O.P. representative, Micah Van Huss, filed a resolution in January to officially recognize CNN and The Washington Post as \"fake news,\" she was \"embarrassed.\"But in this moment, even she doesn't feel that she can trust the media to present the pandemic's full picture.\"No matter what outlet you go to about this,\" she said, \"somebody is always taking a side.\"Much of Mr. Trump's success has been fueled by his supporters' distrust of career government officials. Yet as coronavirus cases multiply, many of those same supporters find themselves placing their faith in institutions like the C.D.C. -- confident for perhaps the first time in Mr. Trump's tenure that the experts on call aren't out to sabotage the president.In conversations over the course of the past week, as the news and administration action on the virus moved quickly, Mr. Trump's supporters overwhelmingly have said they trust the president and they trust whom he trusts. They are not, in large part, completely dismissive of the virus, the way some right-wing media outlets have been. But they are comforted because they see the president as a bulwark against outright panic, working with business leaders and experts from within a bureaucracy that both the president and many Republicans still distrust.\"I feel like sometimes the decisions he makes are for his voters, and now it's about what's best for the American people,\" Ms. Aistrop said. \"I think he's really looking to our government agencies to take the lead on this, he's listening to them on what to do, and his No. 1 goal is to keep us safe.\"While polling indicates that most Democrats take a sharply negative view of the president and his handling of the virus, and that some Republicans share concerns about Mr. Trump's performance as well, there are no signs at this point that the epidemic has cut deeply into the bedrock support that he enjoys among his base, even in places where infection rates are high and populations are most at risk.Lee Green, a 59-year-old who lives in the Florida retirement community of The Villages and leads the Jewish Conservatives Club there, said she typically gets her news from Facebook, where she is subscribed to updates from outlets like The Daily Wire and The Jerusalem Post. But on Wednesday she struggled to understand why, if the virus was indeed the equivalent of a \"bad flu,\" schools were closing and events were being canceled.Now, she relies on the C.D.C. website for updates. \"I don't see them as political hacks,\" she explained.Ms. Green is confident in the C.D.C., in large part because she believes Mr. Trump is, too. Later in the week, after the president declared a national emergency over the pandemic, her confidence that Mr. Trump was leaning on experts to do what was best for Americans had only soared.\"I'm actually even more impressed after today's press briefing,\" she said on Friday, after the president spoke in the Rose Garden, with top health officials and C.E.O.s. \"I voted for Trump because he's a problem solver. And initially he wanted to be super optimistic about everything, but when the experts told him this was a really big deal, he instantly took action.\"Mr. Trump and public health officials have often contradicted one another when speaking publicly about the virus. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testified before Congress on Thursday about the severity of the outbreak, a day after the president had assured people that the virus would \"go away.\"But when many Americans consume their news in snippets, B-roll footage of the president speaking with agency heads in the Roosevelt Room can be enough to cement impressions of coordination, unity, transparency.Voters said they were comforted watching the recent spate of televised briefings at the White House. They saw the president and vice president standing behind the podium, surrounded by heads of agencies -- the sheer presence of the experts seeming to confirm that Mr. Trump was communicating their findings accurately.\"It's more of a feeling than the actual data,\" Mary Lou Drake, a Trump supporter from The Villages, said on Wednesday. \"It's a feeling of trust in these people that they're working hard, they're doing what they can, they're not shielding information, and they're putting out all the information they have at the moment.\"With four children ranging in age from preschool to sixth grade, Rachel Losey is lucky if she catches CBS radio in the morning and a Tucker Carlson segment at night. The 38-year-old stay-at-home mom, who lives in Battle Creek, Mich., feels that based on what she has heard, the president and his administration have things under control.\"I appreciate what Donald Trump is doing, saying, 'Yeah, there's a problem, we're taking care of it, but don't panic. It's going to be OK, don't freak out about it,\"' she said.That sense of calm, even levity, about the virus permeated places like Battle Creek late in the week, even as the first cases were confirmed in Michigan and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency.\"From what I can see, the president has surrounded himself with people whose main objective is to contain this without causing unnecessary worry,\" said Ryan Leonard, a 49-year-old real estate agent who volunteers for the Calhoun County G.O.P.The result, he added, is that beyond what he describes as \"common-sense\" measures like more frequent hand-washing, \"people around here aren't taking it all that seriously.\"Mr. Leonard said that his Facebook feed was mostly filled with jokes about the virus, such as an image of Hillary Clinton captioned, \"If the coronavirus was a person ...\"But while many Trump supporters have found a new regard for experts and expertise, their disdain for the media, and what they view as unfair treatment of Mr. Trump, is more trenchant than ever.Mr. Leonard said on Thursday that he thought the severity of the virus was a media-spawned \"hoax.\"\"The opinion from the conservative channels is that the mainstream media is making a manufactured sort of crisis,\" he said. \"We haven't contained the common flu, we haven't contained the common cold, but since the president hasn't contained this, he's bad.\"\"And you know, honestly, they lost the election, and then impeachment failed, all of these things,\" Mr. Leonard added. \"I think they're just grasping at straws to try and make our president look incompetent when he's the best president we've ever had.\"Indeed, as these Trump supporters see it, in the same way that the Mueller probe, impeachment or any other scandal in this administration has failed to bring down the president, coronavirus -- stock-market free falls and all -- will seem a distant memory by November.That feeling persists among some voters even as Mr. Trump's recent actions, such as declaring a national state of emergency, seem to signal that his administration views the pandemic as more than a bad flu. Yet some of his supporters remain firm that the president's opponents are using the outbreak for their gain.On Tuesday, a day before the World Health Organization declared the new coronavirus a global pandemic, Mark Hammond, a Republican from La Plata, Md., logged into Facebook and marked himself \"safe from whatever it is the media wants me to be afraid of today.\"\"It's a scare tactic,\" he said, of media coverage of the crisis. \"Altogether it's part of a Democratic long game.\"Mr. Hammond, who has a home remodeling company and runs a Facebook group called \"Patriots Against Impeachment,\" said he attended this year's Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C., where an attendee tested positive for the virus. When asked if he was worried about becoming infected or about the pandemic generally, Mr. Hammond was clear: \"110 percent, no.\"\"I have not changed one thing in my daily life,\" he said, adding that for the past decade he has kept a \"ready bag\" and six months' worth of supplies on hand, just in case an emergency arises.For many Trump supporters, this moment is unsettling -- though not linked, in their mind, to the president himself.Jeff Schumacher, a 42-year-old realtor, lives in suburban Seattle, so far one of the areas in the nation hardest hit by the virus. He is juggling his work and his three children being at home after schools closed, and is watching supplies dwindle in stores near his home in Everett.He voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and plans to vote for him again. He thinks he is handling the outbreak better than other presidents of either party would have.\"He has a business approach perspective to his management,\" Mr. Schumacher said. \"This is a virus. This is not a Trump problem, it's a world problem.\"PhotographPresident Trump in the Rose Garden on Friday afternoon. His news conference was closely watched by his supporters, and one said she was \"even more impressed\" at his handling of the crisis. Rachel Losey, left, said his leadership has kept her calm.

Stone Jr., President Trump's longtime friend and former campaign adviser, to up to nine years in prison for lying to Congress and tampering with a witness to prevent investigators from discovering how the 2016 Trump campaign tried to benefit from stolen Democratic documents.Mr. Stone, 67, deserved seven to nine years behind bars because he threatened the witness with bodily harm, interfered with a congressional investigation and then, after he was charged in a federal indictment, repeatedly flouted the orders of the judge overseeing his case, the prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum.In a multiyear scheme, the prosecutors said, Mr. Stone lied under oath, forged documents and engaged in \"a relentless and elaborate campaign to silence\" the witness because he could have exposed his lies to the House Intelligence Committee. When flattery failed, they said, he harassed the witness and even threatened his life and that of his dog. Even if the witness believed Mr. Stone would personally never injure him, he feared that he could inspire others to do so, they said.\"Stone's actions were not a one-off mistake in judgment. Nor were his false statements made in the heat of the moment. They were nowhere close to that,\" the prosecutors argued. \"Stone's conduct over the past two years shows the low regard in which he holds the House Intelligence Committee's investigation and this very criminal case.\"In their own memorandum, Mr. Stone's lawyers argued that the prosecutors had misconstrued harmless messages from Mr. Stone to the witness, a New York radio host named Randy Credico, as genuine threats. They argued that Mr. Stone should be sentenced to less than 15 months in prison for the seven felonies he was found guilty of in November.The evidence in Mr. Stone's jury trial showed that in the months before the election, he strove to obtain emails that Russia had stolen from Democratic Party computers and funneled to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks then released the emails at strategic moments to damage Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump's Democratic opponent.Prosecutors claimed that Mr. Stone used every chance he had to brief the Trump campaign about whatever he picked up about WikiLeaks' plans. But in September 2017, he told the House Intelligence Committee that he never described to anyone involved in the Trump campaign his conversations with an intermediary to WikiLeaks. To cover up his lies, he urged Mr. Credico to take the Fifth Amendment rather than testify before the committee.\"Stone's criminal conduct was not an act of desperation. He is a man of substantial means, and he has enjoyed a modicum of fame from his years of being a political adviser and confidant to powerful politicians,\" the prosecutors wrote. \"His conduct was undertaken purposefully, by someone who knew exactly what he was doing.\"But the defense lawyers argued that Mr. Stone not only never intended to threaten Mr. Credico, but created no real obstacle for federal investigators. While Mr. Credico refused to testify before Congress, he cooperated fully with the special counsel's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, they argued. And he in fact had no incriminating information about the Trump campaign or WikiLeaks, they said.Mr. Credico himself submitted a letter asking the judge not to send Mr. Stone to prison, saying incarceration damaged both prisoners and their families. While he stood by his testimony during the trial, he wrote, \"I never in any way felt that Stone himself posed a direct physical threat to me or my dog.\"On the eve of the jury's verdict in his trial in November, Mr. Stone appeared to appeal to the president for a pardon, using as his proxy Alex Jones, a right-wing conspiracy theorist who runs the website Infowars. Although Mr. Trump has said nothing about pardoning Mr. Stone, he quickly criticized the verdict, suggesting that prosecutors and F.B.I. officials had themselves lied during the Russia investigation.Prosecutors characterized Mr. Stone's apparent appeal for a pardon as part of a pattern of violations of gag orders imposed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the United States District Court in Washington, who oversaw his case. They argued that Mr. Stone's behavior before and after he was criminally charged underscored the need for a prison term to teach him respect for the law.The prosecutors also stressed that Mr. Stone had threatened the judge herself in February 2019, when he posted a photo of her with an image of what appeared to be the cross hairs of a gun next to her head on social media. During a hearing on the matter, the prosecutors said, Mr. Stone \"openly lied to this court about matters directly affecting the integrity of these proceedings.\"The prosecutors' request that Mr. Stone be imprisoned contrasted sharply with their recent plea for leniency in the case of Rick Gates, Mr. Trump's former deputy campaign chairman who also helped manage his inauguration. In recognition of his cooperation with the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, prosecutors asked that Mr. Gates be sentenced to probation for his part in a criminal financial conspiracy and for lying to federal prosecutors.Judge Jackson, who also oversaw that case, sentenced Mr. Gates in December to 45 days in jail.PhotographRoger J.

With one more Republican, Democrats could commandeer the proceedings.WASHINGTON -- The Capitol math is clear: Democrats need only four Republican votes to force the Senate to subpoena witnesses like John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, to testify in President Trump's impeachment trial. Three have signaled they may be open to doing so: Senators Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski.That leaves Democrats searching for an elusive fourth vote.The question of whether four Republicans will defect -- and if so, who -- looms large in the Capitol as the Senate prepares to receive articles of impeachment from the House on Wednesday, prompting the third presidential impeachment trial in American history. If they did, Democrats could effectively commandeer the Senate floor during the proceeding and defy Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, by moving to call witnesses.That could derail Mr. McConnell's hopes to secure a quick acquittal of Mr. Trump with little debate, drastically altering the course of the trial -- and potentially, of Mr. Trump's presidency.\"I can't predict to whether we'll have witnesses or not,\" Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said Tuesday. \"At first everyone said no, McConnell seemed to rule the roost. Now we're having some people entertain it, but you don't know what's going to happen. So we're in better shape than we were a few weeks ago, but there's no certainties here at all.\"In recent days, Mr. Schumer, Mr. McConnell and members of Mr. Trump's team have been privately obsessed with the possibility that a fourth Republican could emerge and tip the math in Democrats' direction, even as all of them concede they are unsure who that would be.So far, only Mr. Romney has said explicitly that he wants Mr. Bolton to appear. Ms. Collins, who is facing a tough re-election fight in Maine, and Ms. Murkowski have been a bit cagier, saying that they want the Senate to vote on whether to have witnesses or documents, but only after both sides present their cases.\"Am I curious about what Ambassador Bolton would have to say? Yes, I am,\" Ms. Murkowski told reporters, according to Alaska Public Radio. But she said she would not \"prejudge\" the need for him to testify until after the cases are presented.Ms. Collins, whose reputation for independence took a hit in Maine when she voted to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, is under pressure from all sides. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the Senate, has created a website -- WhatChangedSusan.com -- spotlighting her push for witnesses during the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.\"It's time for Senator Collins to commit to a fair process, stand up to Mitch McConnell, and demand a proper trial in the Senate,\" the website declared.But Ms. Collins has suggested all along that she will do just that.\"I tend to like information,\" she said on Monday, adding that she would not be pushing for the option to call witnesses \"if I did not anticipate at the end of hearing the case presented, and the Q. and A., that there might be a need for more information.\"The names of other Republican senators -- including Cory Gardner, who is in a tough 2020 race in Colorado, and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is respectful of Senate institutions and is retiring and thus freer to vote his conscience -- have also been raised as possibilities. Mr. Gardner can ill afford to break with Mr. Trump.But Mr. Alexander is of genuine concern to the White House, according to a senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity to characterize the perspective of Mr. Trump's team. On Monday, he appeared to join the Collins-Murkowski wait-and-see camp.\"We're taking an oath to be impartial,\" Mr. Alexander told reporters in the Capitol, \"and that to me means we have a constitutional duty to hear the case, ask our questions and then decide whether we want additional evidence in terms of documents or witnesses.\"After the House voted last month to impeach the president on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors in connection with his campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, Mr. Schumer issued a list of four witnesses Democrats want to call. Those include Mr. Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff.Mr. Bolton has since said he would be willing to testify if the Senate issued a subpoena.Democrats also want to subpoena documents, including administration emails showing that the White House ordered the suspension of military aid to Ukraine just 90 minutes after a phone call in which Mr. Trump asked that country's president to investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden.Mr. Trump, who has vacillated between saying he wants witnesses and saying he wants a speedy trial, has at times floated the idea of calling Hunter Biden to testify. If Democrats succeed in calling Mr. Bolton or other witnesses, it is likely that Republicans would push to call the Bidens. On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell met with a small group of Republican senators to explore that idea of \"witness reciprocity,\" according to two people familiar with the discussions.The question is not going to be settled immediately. Mr. McConnell has indicated that he has the support of 53 Republicans -- two more than the 51 he needs for a majority -- to adopt an organizing resolution governing the first phase of the trial, in which both sides will present their cases and senators may ask questions. That will take roughly two weeks.Mr. McConnell has said he wants the resolution to adhere closely to the one used in the Clinton trial, which specified that once the first phase was complete, the Senate would vote on whether to call witnesses. Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and a member of leadership, said on Tuesday that he expected the resolution governing the trial would also include that language.For Republicans in difficult re-election races -- with the possible exception of Ms. Collins, who is her own brand in Maine -- the political calculations are complex. Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Martha McSally of Arizona and Mr. Gardner all face tough contests in states that are not nearly as conservative as they used to be.Democrats are unlikely to support them no matter what they do, and alienating Mr. Trump could be disastrous for them.\"This is Cory's problem, or challenge: There's a very restless Republican base in Colorado and Cory cannot afford to alienate that base because he cannot afford any defections from the base in a general election,\" said Richard Wadhams, a Republican strategist in Colorado who is close to Mr. Gardner.\"He's in a very vulnerable position right now in the Senate election,\" Mr. Wadhams added, \"but believe me, it is much more dangerous for him to appear not to be supporting Trump than it is to be supporting McConnell and the president in Colorado.\"The pressure on Mr. Gardner mounted on Monday when the Lincoln Project, a group of Republicans that describes itself as \"dedicated to defeating President Trump and Trumpism,\" targeted him in a brutal advertisement that described the Colorado senator as \"just another Trump servant -- weak, frightened, impotent -- a small man, terrified of a political bully.\"\"Colorado voters want a fair trial in the Senate and honest leadership,\" the ad said. \"Either do your job, or Colorado will find someone who will.\"In the Capitol on Tuesday, Mr. Gardner was making himself scarce. When Republicans wrapped up a luncheon featuring a discussion of trial procedure, he zipped out a back door and headed for a little-used elevator, avoiding a throng of waiting reporters.\"I'm sorry, he's got to get going,\" an aide to Mr. Gardner told a reporter who followed him, as the elevator doors opened and the senator slipped inside. Then Mr. Gardner jumped in, begging off any discussion of whether he could be the elusive fourth vote who could upend hopes of a quick acquittal of Mr. Trump.\"We don't have the articles yet,\" he said, \"and I'm not going to speculate.\"Catie Edmondson contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.Catie Edmondson contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographMitt Romney is the only Republican in the Senate so far to say he wants John R.

America respects India,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And America will always be faithful and loyal friends to the Indian people.\"The \"Namaste Trump\" rally, a daylong affair featuring popular singers, dancers and pounding music, took place under a blazing sun in the city's Motera Stadium, which India calls the largest of its kind in the world. It was an unabashed homage to Mr. Trump, whose name and image appeared in dozens of banners and billboards throughout the stadium.Mr. Trump looked out with satisfaction at the grand display, and said it had made a lasting impression on him.\"We will always remember this remarkable hospitality. We will remember it forever,\" Mr. Trump said to loud cheers, as his wife, Melania, sat nearby. \"From this day onward, India will always hold a special place in our hearts.\"But even as he name-checked famous cricket players and Bollywood stars, Mr. Trump betrayed unfamiliarity with the country -- and even his immediate location -- when he stumbled over several pronunciations, including those of Ahmedabad itself, as well as Gujarat, the state it anchors and Mr. Modi's political home base.And although Mr. Trump said with satisfaction that 125,000 people had turned out to see him, more than one third of the crowd appeared to leave before the end of his nearly 30-minute remarks, and another third was gone by the time Mr. Modi spoke after him.The event was the mirror image of a \"Howdy, Modi!\" rally the two men held at a football stadium in Houston last September, and catered to Mr. Trump's taste for a giant crowd. It also made vivid an image the leaders are jointly cultivating as larger-than-life, unapologetically brash figures leading their countries to bright new futures -- even as critics call them mutual enablers in parallel assaults on democratic and religious freedoms.\"Two dynamic personalities, one momentous occasion,\" declared one billboard in Ahmedabad, highlighting a personal dynamic that, for now, overshadows more substantive hangups in the U.S.-India relationship. Those included Mr. Trump's efforts to strike a peace agreement with the Taliban and slow progress toward a trade deal.Mr. Trump said that he and Mr. Modi would eventually be making \"very, very major\" trade deals, but added that they are in the \"early stages of discussion.\" Mr. Modi was \"a very tough negotiator,\" he joked.But that was about as critical as Mr. Trump got in remarks that hailed Mr. Modi for his \"landslide\" 2019 re-election, which Mr. Trump noted was the largest democratic election on Earth. Making no mention of a growing backlash against what critics call Mr. Modi's anti-Muslim Hindu nationalism, Mr. Trump praised India for its unity and echoed the Indian leader's own stump speeches by noting anti-poverty efforts that have provided more electricity, cooking gas and toilets to rural Indians.It was further evidence that Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi have developed a personal bond, or at least a political partnership, one Mr. Modi has skilfully created with the glue of flattery. Before departing from Washington on Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters that his appearance here would be \"the biggest event they've ever had in India. That's what the prime minister told me.\" (The rally was likely not even the biggest Indian turnout for an American president: Dwight D. Eisenhower drew a crowd of one million during a 1959 visit to New Delhi, according to an Associated Press report at the time.)Onstage, the two men hugged repeatedly, and Mr. Modi lavished his guest with praise.\"President Trump thinks big, and the world knows what he has done to realize the American dream,\" Mr. Modi said to the cheering crowd.Although Ahmedabad did not deliver the 10 million well-wishers that Mr. Trump has also said Mr. Modi promised to turn out -- the entire city's population is less than 6 million, and television images suggested tens of thousands, not millions in the streets -- the city feted him with costumed musicians and dancers, and even a marching band on camels.Motera Stadium -- formally known as Sardar Patel Stadium, and still partly under construction -- was full at the outset of Mr. Trump's remarks, with tens of thousands sitting for hours in temperatures well above 80 degrees. Some Indians wore Modi masks and waved American flags while they danced to the popular Indian musicians who warmed up the crowd.Mr. Trump departed from the event for Agra and a sunset tour of the Taj Mahal. From there he heads to New Delhi, where he will meet with Mr. Modi before attending a state banquet.Major roads in the three cities were teeming with giant posters and billboards of Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi, along with inspiring slogans trumpeting the U.S.-India relationship.\"World's oldest democracy meets world's largest democracy,\" proclaimed one. But skeptics of the two men say they have each undermined democratic traditions by demonizing immigrants, promoting nationalism and seeking to suppress media freedoms.Mr. Trump has shown little public concern for actions by Mr. Modi that have drawn international condemnation, including abruptly revoking the statehood of predominantly Muslim Kashmir and backing a law establishing a religious test for new migrants that critics call evidence of plans to turn India into a Hindu-centric state whose 200 million Muslims would be second-class citizens.Sectarian-themed clashes erupted in northeast New Delhi on Monday, as people for and against Mr. Modi's new immigration law fought in the streets. A policeman was killed amid rising tensions between Hindus and Muslims in that area, officials said.Still, those contentious issues went unmentioned during Monday's event, although Trump administration official told reporters on Friday that Mr. Trump would talk during his visit \"about our shared tradition of democracy and religious freedom both in his public remarks and then certainly in private.\" Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi are scheduled to hold a news conference in New Delhi on Tuesday.Mr. Trump drew some of the day's loudest cheers when he mentioned India's rival and neighbor, Pakistan, saying that he was working with that country \"to crack down on the terrorist organizations\" that operate along its border with India, and which New Delhi sees as a mortal threat\"Every nation has the right to secure and controlled borders. The United States and India are committed to working together to stop terrorists and to fight their ideology,\" Mr. Trump said.Mr. Trump, who tweeted good wishes to India in Hindi before and after his arrival, was joined on his flight there by his wife Melania, his daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. Before arriving at the stadium, Mr. Trump removed his shoes and donned a traditional scarf for a visit to an ashram where the former Indian leader Mohandas K. Gandhi once lived.Ahmedabad is the biggest city and the main business hub in Gujarat, Mr. Modi's home and political base. Many of the most influential Indian-Americans are also originally from Gujarat, and a growing source of political and financial support for Mr. Trump as he heads toward re-election. Mr. Trump said on Monday that four million Indian-Americans live in the United States, including \"titans of business\" and \"pioneers of science.\"Gujarat is also the place where Mr. Modi's critics say that he, as chief minister of the state, played an unforgivable role during a wave of sectarian violence in 2002 that left more than 1,000 people dead -- almost 800 of whom were Muslims killed by Hindu mobs.Mr. Modi has been widely accused of at least tacitly supporting the violence. Much of the killing was done by members of his political party and other Hindu nationalist groups. Many witnesses said police officers did not intervene and in many cases joined in the killing.Mr. Modi denies those accusations. But the George W. Bush administration was suspicious enough of Mr. Modi's role to ban him in 2005 from visiting the United States.When he became prime minister in the spring of 2014, the travel ban was lifted, and later that year, Mr. Modi made his first triumphant visit to the United States, where he had a private dinner with President Obama.Mr. Trump is popular in India, where 2019 polling by the Pew Research Center found 56 percent of citizens expressed confidence in him to handle world affairs -- one of just a half-dozen nations to register a majority on that question. In many other countries, he is more apt to draw crowds of protesters than admirers. Attendees at Monday's rally seemed dazzled.\"If they don't make any deals, that's fine,\" said Mahesh Banker, a 50-year-old doctor who attended the rally with friends. \"But India is shining, and America recognizes that, and that's all that matters.\"Another attendee, Harsh Patel, a 21-year-old from Gujarat who now lives in Canada, drew comparisons between the two leaders. \"Modi is a strong leader, passionate about his people, and he works for them,\" he said. \"He's unorthodox, and doesn't care what people think. Kind of like Trump.\"In addition to hanging hundreds of banners and billboards, India's government hurried in recent days to make cosmetic improvements to all three of the cities Mr. Trump is visiting. In Ahmedabad, a new wall appeared that happened to conceal a slum.And in Agra on Sunday, a day before Mr. Trump's arrival, workers were busy paving streets in and around the Taj Mahal compound. \"Trump is coming!\" volunteered one worker filling cracks in a sidewalk leading to the famous structure.Local media reports chronicled efforts by officials to chase away the hundreds of monkeys who perennially roam around the structure and which can be hostile to people. No monkeys were visible on the grounds during Mr. Trump's visit.Reporting was contributed by Maria Abi-Habib and Hari Kumar from Ahmedabad, India; and by Jeffrey Gettleman, Shalini Venugopal and Suhasini Raj from New Delhi.PhotographAttendees at the \"Namaste Trump\" rally in Ahmedabad, India, on Monday.

Mr. Trump announced that same day he would be holding a rally in New Jersey on Tuesday.The Justice Department's decision to side with the two counties may signal that Mr. Van Drew -- who will speak at Mr. Trump's rally in Wildwood, N.J. -- intends to make immigration a central plank in his re-election campaign, just as Mr. Trump has done.Mr. Van Drew did not immediately respond to requests for comment.John J. Farmer Jr., a former New Jersey attorney general and director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, said politics did seem to play a part in the timing of the move. \"It should be seen as an attempt by the president to inspire his base in South Jersey, where he does have support, and as an attempt to bolster Van Drew's newfound status as a Republican,\" he said.Mr. Farmer said the federal officials' involvement in the suit should also be viewed in light of an \"unusually high\" volume of litigation between Gov. Philip D. Murphy's administration and Mr. Trump's Justice Department. \"Completely different world views colliding, that is what is happening here,\" Mr. Farmer said.Mr. Trump's forthcoming appearance at the Wildwood Convention Center will be his first campaign rally in the state as president, though he frequently has visited his golf courses there.New Jersey has tended recently to lean Democratic, voting overwhelmingly for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Democratic Party also controls both the governor's office and the Legislature. But the rally will take place in a more conservative area in the southern part of the state that is more friendly to Republicans.The event is expected to draw thousands of Trump supporters, including from out of state. Mr. Van Drew told Fox News that 100,000 tickets had been requested for the rally at the venue, which holds 7,400 people.At issue in the lawsuit is the New Jersey attorney general's Immigrant Trust Directive, which the Justice Department is asking to be declared unconstitutional. (The federal officials are not a party in the lawsuit, but will be supporting the counties' efforts.)The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign declined to comment.The state attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal, said in a statement on Saturday that he was \"deeply disappointed\" that federal officials \"have suddenly chosen to challenge\" the directive in court.Mr. Grewal said the directive had played an important role in \"ensuring that victims and witnesses come forward and report crimes to law enforcement without fear of deportation.\"He added: \"The federal government's efforts to coerce states into implementing its immigration agenda have failed repeatedly in the past, and we'll respond to their latest efforts in court at the appropriate time.\"Issued in November 2018, the state attorney general's directive laid out rules limiting the extent to which local and state law enforcement can assist federal civil immigration enforcement efforts. It restricts law enforcement from sharing information with federal authorities and prohibits asking people about their immigration status.It allows law enforcement officers to turn over undocumented immigrants charged with certain crimes to United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, but only if enforcement agents pick up the migrants on the day of their release.Cape May County and Ocean County filed separate lawsuits last fall opposing the directive, but those lawsuits were consolidated before the Justice Department got involved in the suit.State Senator Michael Testa Jr., a Republican who is one of the lawyers who filed the lawsuit on behalf of Cape May County, said he had not been consulted about the Justice Department's decision.But he criticized the limits the directive places on local law enforcement officers' ability to cooperate with ICE.\"I really don't understand why our attorney general would not want to have coordination between law enforcement agencies at the county level, with ICE, when an individual who is here in this country illegally has in fact committed a crime,\" said Mr. Testa, who is an honorary chairman of Mr. Trump's re-election campaign in New Jersey.The Justice Department has repeatedly spoken out against what it calls sanctuary policies around the country and has attempted to cut off federal funding to jurisdictions that have laws limiting cooperation with ICE.It is not the first time it has gotten involved in legal challenges to such policies under Mr. Trump. In 2018, the Justice Department unsuccessfully filed its own suit challenging California's sanctuary laws. A federal judge largely ruled against the administration's case in July of that year, saying that the state never violated the Constitution by passing its own laws. The department lost again on appeal last spring.In New Jersey, most local law enforcement officers have supported the attorney general's directive, which went into effect last March, saying that it has helped reassure immigrants that they can interact with law enforcement without risking deportation.In Bridgeton, a rural community in southern New Jersey that is home to many Latino immigrants, the police have been conducting a monthslong search for Dulce Maria Alavez, a 5-year-old who disappeared from a park in September. Michael A. Gaimari Sr., the police chief in Bridgeton, said he was \"disappointed\" to learn that the Justice Department had joined the challenge to the statewide directive.\"We have been trying to break down the barriers to get the information we need to investigate cases like this one -- that becomes difficult when there's fear,\" he said.Activists also lamented that the federal government was throwing its weight behind the legal challenge to the directive.\"Before the directive, immigrants in New Jersey feared even the slightest contact with law enforcement could lead to family separations,\" said Sara Cullinane, the director of Make The Road Action in New Jersey, an advocacy group. \"Since the directive went into effect, we have seen that trust has been significantly repaired.\"Tracey Tully and Katie Benner contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump with Representative Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who just became a Republican.

But the juxtaposition this year was something quite different.PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Beneath wind-swept palm trees and gilded chandeliers, President Trump dined with Rush Limbaugh and congratulated Keith Hernandez, the Mets announcer and former first baseman, on his wedding. He consulted with his national security and campaign advisers while basking in 80-degree weather, and, as always, he tweeted.He also authorized a military strike that has roiled the Middle East and is likely to endure as one of the most consequential acts of his presidency.For three years, Mr. Trump's winter visits to Mar-a-Lago, his private club, have allowed him time to combine his personal and presidential business, often in the midst of the club's wealthy members and his adoring friends.But the jarring juxtapositions this year seemed to highlight some central elements in the way Mr. Trump has governed: the little interest he has in planning beyond the day in front of him, his need for positive feedback and an unwillingness to modulate his behavior, whatever the circumstance.From the outside, the president's two-week winter vacation in Palm Beach, Fla., seemed similar to his previous long stays, except for the fact that he had recently been impeached.The days were generally marked by casual-wear trips to his nearby golf club, where he would talk with members and meet with White House advisers. The evenings were marked by elaborate dinners at Mar-a-Lago that included his family members, his campaign advisers and his national security aides.But Mr. Trump's vacation was more than the usual refuge from negative news coverage and official Washington. He was agitated by uncertainty about what comes next in the impeachment process, and expressed gnawing concerns about how much the billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg is spending on his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination in the election that Mr. Trump hopes to win.Throughout Christmas week, the president watched the news coverage on impeachment and tweeted his frustrations with Speaker Nancy Pelosi for slowing down the process by refusing to send to the Senate the articles charging him with high crimes and misdemeanors. He spoke with advisers about what the Senate trial might look like.And there were other grievances, as well.On Sunday, Dec. 29, hours after a stabbing at the home of a rabbi in Monsey, N.Y., Mr. Trump, from his golf club in West Palm Beach, called one of his oldest acquaintances and major Jewish supporters, the cosmetics billionaire Ronald S. Lauder, to yell that Mr. Lauder should be doing more to \"support\" him, according to three people briefed on the call.Mr. Lauder, the president of the World Jewish Congress who recently started a new $25 million effort to fight anti-Semitism that employs a pollster working for Mr. Bloomberg, listened as Mr. Trump ticked off a litany of administration actions. Mr. Trump said that he had done more for Jews than any other president and that he could still lose the Jewish vote. The president never mentioned campaign contributions, but advisers and others briefed on the call said he left the clear impression that was referring to financial support.In a statement, Mr. Lauder would say only that he has had \"many candid, positive and forward-looking conversations with\" Mr. Trump, who \"deserves a great deal of support from the Jewish community for his fantastic record on Israel and his proven support of the Jewish people here at home.\"Then it was time to get back to White House work, and Mr. Trump huddled with advisers offering him a range of options on how to respond to the death of an American civilian contractor killed on Dec. 27 in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base. The menu of choices included the most extreme one -- killing Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran's most powerful commander.On New Year's Eve, Mr. Trump hosted his annual party at Mar-a-Lago, arriving in a tuxedo with the first lady, Melania Trump, and playing M.C. to a crowd that included his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani.On Jan. 2, the president began his day at his golf club. But mindful of not appearing weak in the face the rocket attack and concerned that an assault on the American Embassy in Baghdad that United States officials said was orchestrated by Iran could have ended in devastation, Mr. Trump had already settled on a course of action.In the middle of a meeting with campaign advisers, he left the table to give the final authorization to kill General Suleimani. The president then returned, and, compartmentalizing what had just happened, resumed talking about the campaign.It was an act of enormous consequence, but the White House made no public statement for hours, though the president cryptically tweeted about what had taken place. Whatever the administration's objectives were, and whatever intelligence they had used to justify the strike, it was not being shared in any conventional fashion.Mr. Trump closely monitored reactions to his military action, taking note of who praised him publicly among Republicans and who did not, like Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host. He was encouraged by others on the Trump-friendly network.But finally, on Friday afternoon, as he was about leave on a short helicopter ride to Miami for a campaign event with evangelical supporters, he abruptly agreed to make a statement on the strike.His decision to speak came partly at the prodding of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who had jumped in to try to direct the public response.So aides draped one of the private dining rooms at Mar-a-Lago with a presidential blue cloth as a backdrop to the presidential podium. Roughly five minutes after he started talking, Mr. Trump was done.Next up was Miami, and there, at the King Jesus International Ministry, he excoriated the \"fake news,\" declared from the dais that two progressive congresswomen \"hate\" Jewish people, taunted the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg for his faith, and said God was \"on our side.\"The president's final day of vacation, Saturday, was spent at the golf club, and was punctuated by a handful of tweets.That night, Mr. Trump strolled through Mar-a-Lago, a phalanx of aides in tow, as Mr. Hernandez got married in an adjacent room, according to attendees. The president did not attend the wedding, but did offer congratulations.Some people reached out to shake his hand or just to touch his arm as he passed their tables. For the second night, Mr. Trump heard approval from club members and their guests who thought he had acted decisively.Less than 24 hours later, he began his return to Washington, where the temperature was much colder and the grind of his fourth year in office and his campaign for another term were just beginning.PhotographWith a makeshift curtain behind the presidential lectern, President Trump on Friday addressed the strike that killed the Iranian leader Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. (PHOTOGRAPH BY ERIC THAYER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1153Show lessYou have requested \"on-the-fly\" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

And the White House hasn't gone out of its way to help.WICHITA FALLS, Texas -- Dressed in cowboy boots and jeans, with an American flag pin on his lapel, Dr. Ronny L. Jackson rolled up at the Red River Harley-Davidson outpost to make his pitch to voters.\"I just came from the White House,\" Dr. Jackson, the former White House physician, told the small crowd gathered upstairs from the Harley showroom. \"I've been working side by side with the president. I know all the cabinet secretaries. I have their cellphones. I know the chief of staff, the national security adviser. I can pick the phone up and I can call them. They're all friends of mine.\"Dr. Jackson left the West Wing in December after rising from President Trump's physician to his unlikely pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs to Trump administration roadkill when he was forced to withdraw his name from consideration amid allegations related to his professional conduct.Now he's running for Congress in Texas' 13th District, one of the most conservative in the country, and his argument is simple. In a primary field of 15 anti-immigrant, anti-abortion Republicans, Dr. Jackson is betting his personal connection with the president is enough to win the Republican nomination tantamount to election.Standing alongside other candidates wearing cowboy hats and \"Make America Great Again\" caps at the forum on Thursday, Dr. Jackson pitched himself as the only one \"who can walk in the Oval Office unannounced and say, 'Sir, I need you to stop what you're doing and listen to me,' and he will stop what he's doing and listen to me.\"That access, he said, would make him an unusually powerful replacement for Representative Mac Thornberry, the Republican who announced last fall he would not seek re-election after representing his district for more than a quarter of a century.But it is not clear if that connection, combined with his background as a Navy rear admiral, will be enough to help Dr. Jackson overcome some rookie mistakes as a candidate. There have been more than a few.His campaign organization, for one thing.Dr. Jackson's campaign manager, he said, is \"a horse doctor\" with a full-time job. He has one full-time staff member, a recent college graduate who is also working for free, and he has relied on his wife, Jane, to drive him around the enormous Panhandle-encompassing district, which spans 41 counties. And despite having a power Rolodex, he has never reached into it to ask the right people for help.On Friday, Dr. Jackson spent the afternoon knocking on doors in Wichita Falls, only to realize that it was a relatively futile exercise since most people weren't home. In the evening, he mingled in the bleachers at the Monarch Motor Speedway only to report back to his wife that most of spectators had driven in from Oklahoma.While waiting for the stock car race to begin, Dr. Jackson laughed when a hunk of mud spun up from the dirt track and landed in his coffee cup, a fitting end to another long day on the campaign trail where it wasn't clear if he'd made any progress.Dr. Jackson, who grew up in Levelland, Texas, returned to the Panhandle after leaving the White House and retiring from the Navy, settling in the district in Amarillo. He thought his connections to Mr. Trump and the extended Trumpworld would make him a shoo-in for the seat, people who spoke to him at the time said.But Mr. Trump, who now generally adheres to rules put in place by his political shop about whom he endorses and what races he weighs in on, has been silent about Dr. Jackson's campaign. Donald Trump Jr., whom Dr. Jackson considers a close friend, has no plans to get involved in his race or officially endorse him, an aide said. And even Rick Perry, the former energy secretary and Texas governor who encouraged him to run and then endorsed him, has not campaigned for him.Dr. Jackson is now facing an uphill battle against two well-funded and connected opponents -- Chris Ekstrom, a Dallas millionaire who recently moved to the district to run and is self-funding his campaign, and Josh Winegarner, a lobbyist who has the backing of the cattle industry he represents and Mr. Thornberry.But Dr. Jackson's connections to the Trump administration as well as the president and his family are real, even if they have not translated into much support.Eric Trump has tweeted a supportive message, and Mr. Trump has privately encouraged Dr. Jackson to run. And Dr. Jackson is benefiting, if belatedly, from Trump allies and aides who have only recently realized he needed help and have pitched in, setting him up with a real online fund-raising and phone prospecting operation, which helped to finally get him on air with a commercial -- a 30-second spot made up entirely of old clips of Mr. Trump praising his character.At the candidates forum, Dr. Jackson, 52, conceded that he had \"never really considered running for office.\" But, he said, \"Trump is getting re-elected. That's a done deal at this point.\"\"I thought this is the unique opportunity for me to get in the game,\" he added. \"I have an opportunity to get in the fight and do something for our country.\"Dr. Jackson, who served in the White House medical unit under the past three presidents, grew close to Mr. Trump after delivering the results of a presidential physical in a briefing at which he promoted Mr. Trump's \"incredible genes,\" said he did \"exceedingly well\" on a cognitive test and claimed that if he had adhered to a better diet over the past 20 years, he could have lived to be 200.His hourlong news conference transformed Dr. Jackson into an inner circle Trump favorite, and a candidate, in Mr. Trump's mind, for a cabinet post. It also changed how he was perceived outside the building.\"That was the day I got the Trump stamp on me completely,\" Dr. Jackson said during an interview last week at a coffee shop in Wichita Falls. \"I was no longer viewed as a nonpartisan physician on military orders, even though I still technically was. What I didn't realize was that it made people much more aggressive toward me when the V.A. nomination came up.\"At the time of the allegations against him -- which included loosely dispensing strong drugs to lawmakers and political aides -- Dr. Jackson was not allowed to respond because he was an active-duty military officer.The experience took a toll on Dr. Jackson and his family.\"I tell people now that I got Kavanaugh-ed before Kavanaugh did,\" he said, referring to Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who he believes was falsely accused of sexual assault during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. \"I was the pregame but I didn't know it. I was the warm up.\"Dr. Jackson called the allegations against him \"complete garbage\" and hinted at behind-the-scenes plotting from both parties to remove a Trump loyalist from contention.\"I saw the ugly side of Washington,\" he said. He noted that despite the scandal, \"I got promoted in the White House, I maintained my clearance, I stayed in the military, I retired as a Navy admiral. Come on.\"Mr. Trump mounted an aggressive defense of Dr. Jackson, even as a bipartisan group of Senators expressed concerns over his record. The president called for Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, to resign for his lead role in releasing details of the allegations against Dr. Jackson.Mr. Trump called Dr. Jackson \"one of the finest people that I have met\" while elevating him to the role of assistant to the president. And in the 13th District, those words may be more important than any accusation.\"I'm leaning toward Ronny because I have to look at who's electable,\" said Danny Breegle, a business owner in Wichita Falls who attended the Thursday night forum. He said he was impressed with his résumé and \"wanted to make sure he's not of the swamp, and now I think he's independent.\"But for Dr. Jackson, the question will be whether the last-ditch help from Trumpworld has come too late -- by Friday, over half of the vote will already be in because of early voting in the March 3 primary.In the interview, Dr. Jackson admitted that he had not been aggressive in calling in favors, especially from the president. \"He had so much on his plate. He was going through impeachment,\" Dr. Jackson said. \"I thought, I'm not going to put 'Ronny Jackson in the 13th Congressional District' on his plate.\"If he wins the seat, Dr. Jackson will be back on a government salary. If he loses, he said, he plans to make enough money to buy his wife any house in Amarillo she wants.That is, if he doesn't go back into the Trump administration. Dr. Jackson appeared to leave himself open to the possibility, but said his wife was committed to staying in Texas.For now, Dr. Jackson said, he has put a cabinet post in his rear view mirror, calling the Veterans Affairs Department a \"massive bureaucracy\" and asserting that \"my ability to impact things will actually be better if I'm a congressman, even for the veterans.\"One of his regrets was moving on from his post as White House physician before he could help institute the diet and exercise regimen he had planned for the president.During his infamous news conference, Mr. Jackson said his goal was to help Mr. Trump lose 10 to 15 pounds and that he planned to bring an exercise bike or elliptical machine into the White House residence.Mr. Jackson said those plans never came to pass. (Mr. Trump had gained four pounds by his following physical.) \"The exercise stuff never took off as much as I wanted it to,\" he said. \"But we were working on his diet. We were making the ice cream less accessible, we were putting cauliflower into the mashed potatoes.\"PhotographDr. Ronny L.

But a recent policy reversal is stoking the most concern.WASHINGTON -- Senators will vet Judy Shelton, a prominent Federal Reserve critic, for one of the central bank's top jobs on Thursday, a moment that many economists will be watching closely because they see her as a potential threat to the Fed's prized independence.Ms. Shelton has rhetorically questioned whether America even needs the Fed. She is a longtime fan of pegging the value of the dollar to some common anchor, like gold, a stance that the United States abandoned decades ago and one that would fundamentally change the nature of the central bank. Despite those unconventional views, she is one of President Trump's two candidates to fill the last remaining seats on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors in Washington.It is not just her heterodox economic views that are making former central bankers and top economists wary, according to interviews. It is the possibility, based on her record, that Ms. Shelton could bend her positions to suit Mr. Trump's preferences, subordinating monetary policy to the White House's desires.The stakes are high. While individual Fed governors have just one vote out of 12 on monetary policy, she could be a natural pick to be the central bank's next chair should Mr. Trump win re-election. That would put her in a position to change the fabric of the institution. While Fed chairs must build consensus among their colleagues, they have historically been the central players in American monetary policy.\"When someone is qualified, shades of gray on their politics, you just don't care -- but when it seems like they're willing to usurp all economics for political gain, that's when you've crossed a line,\" said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. \"It's mind-boggling. It's disturbing. It's dangerous as well, because of the potential for her to be the next Fed chair.\"Ms. Shelton quietly pushed back on such criticism in prepared testimony, which was released Wednesday afternoon. She underlined her research credentials, pointing out that she has written books on economics and spent time at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Ms. Shelton does not mention her previous role as a co-director of the Sound Money Project, which publishes essays and research on topics including the feasibility of returning to the gold standard.Her statement said that she hoped \"to contribute intellectual diversity as a governor\" and that she \"would work collegially to promote sound money and sound finances.\"She would also push to \"support monetary policy that facilitates productive economic growth\" and would vote for regulation that was \"effective, efficient and appropriately tailored to financial institutions.\" The Fed oversees the nation's largest banks.Those views are likely to be seen favorably at the White House.Mr. Trump has spent the past 18 months blasting his hand-chosen Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, for keeping interest rates too high. That suggests Mr. Trump, if he were to win re-election, might not reappoint Mr. Powell when his term as chair expires in early 2022.Ms. Shelton would be one potential replacement. Mr. Trump could also tap one of the other governors he has picked, including Christopher Waller, who is the research director at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and was nominated to the board alongside Ms. Shelton.Mr. Waller, who will also face Senate scrutiny on Thursday, was an academic before joining the Fed and has a record of research more typical of central bankers. For years, the St. Louis Fed has doubted that low unemployment would spur higher inflation, and Mr. Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, has highlighted that skepticism as a key reason the president tapped both Mr. Waller and Ms. Shelton.Given the tension between Mr. Trump and Mr. Powell, \"there's reason to think he's looking at Fed governor nominees and thinking about a future Fed chair,\" said Michael R. Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"That suggests a higher level of scrutiny of these nominees is important.\"Ms. Shelton's public campaigning for the Fed job, which included a series of news media interviews she arranged in the lobby of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, has helped to spur speculation that she might become a favorite to replace Mr. Powell. So have her friendship with Mr. Kudlow and her willingness to change her views.Ms. Shelton called for higher interest rates in the wake of the Great Recession and as recently as 2016. Since Mr. Trump's election, she has spoken out in favor of cuts.She initially couched her change of position as technical: Ms. Shelton said she wanted to cut rates in order to phase out the Fed's postcrisis practice of paying interest on excess money that banks deposit at the central bank. More recently, she has said lower rates would allow the economy to grow uninhibited as the administration's policies fueled higher investment and productivity. (That boom has not materialized.)\"When you have an economy primed to grow because of reduced taxes, less regulation, dynamic energy and trade reforms, you want to ensure maximum access to capital,\" she told The Wall Street Journal's editorial page.She has also previously questioned the basis of the Fed's independence from the White House, even as she acknowledged that central bankers believe that distance shores up their credibility.\"I don't see any reference to independence in the legislation that has defined the role of the Federal Reserve for the United States,\" she said in a question-and-answer session in Washington last year. Related legislation \"demands that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve work hand in hand with Congress and the president to meet certain strategic economic goals for the United States.\"Ms. Shelton did nod at the Fed's independence several times in her written testimony.\"Along with the political independence and operational autonomy granted to the Federal Reserve comes an obligation to be wholly accountable both to Congress and to the public,\" the testimony said.She would hardly be the first appointment to the seven-member Fed Board with a heavy partisan lean. President Ronald Reagan, who was not a fan of Fed independence, stacked the Fed with enough supporters to challenge the chair at the time, Paul A. Volcker.But current Fed officials robustly defend the central bank's independence from politics, and Mr. Powell often says interest rates are set with an eye toward the economy alone because the Fed avoids \"mistakes of character.\" History suggests, and some research shows, that politically tied central bankers can favor policy that hurts the economy in the longer run.Ms. Shelton is expected to face pointed questioning at her confirmation hearing on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee and must ultimately win confirmation from the full Senate.Bankers are skeptical of Ms. Shelton's nomination. One senior financial services executive said her questioning of the Fed's independence, her skepticism of the need for deposit insurance and her track record of advocating an anchored currency are areas that would draw lawmaker questions.When Mr. Powell testifies on Capitol Hill, as he did this week, he is assured that the Fed's independence is valued, and senators have previously shot down possible Trump administration appointments to the Fed's board that were viewed as problematic. The conservative commentator Stephen Moore and the former pizza executive Herman Cain were talked about for the job but were never formally nominated. But it was not monetary policy or partisanship that did them in: Their chances folded after lawmakers expressed concern about their past statements and actions toward women.Lawmakers have approached Ms. Shelton's nomination more cautiously.Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, who had cooled on Mr. Cain, has called Mr. Waller and Ms. Shelton \"well qualified.\" Senator Mike Rounds, Republican of South Dakota, made a case for diverse views at the Fed while questioning Mr. Powell at a Banking Committee hearing on Wednesday.Past Fed nominees have scuppered their chances during their Senate testimonies. But Ms. Shelton has already passed Senate confirmation once, when Mr. Trump nominated her as the American envoy to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. She is a practiced public speaker.If Ms. Shelton is confirmed for the Fed but never elevated as the chair, she will have more limited room to shake things up since individual governors hold just one vote on monetary policy, alongside their six fellow board members and five regional Fed presidents.Governors have historically used public remarks to shape broader policy discussions. Such activism can help to rein in groupthink -- or it can be used to serve a political agenda.\"If Dr. Shelton comes onto the Board of Governors and just represents a different point of view, there is no harm to it and possibly some good,\" said Adam S. Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If, however, this is an attempt to politicize the board's discussion and possibly undermine the chair,\" then \"that would be a loss for the whole country.\"PhotographJudy Shelton, nominated by President Trump to the Fed's Board of Governors, will face questions at her Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday.

When does primary season begin? How long is it?Voting begins Feb. 3 with the Iowa caucuses. The last states vote in early June.So, four months. Like a college semester, except in the end all but one person will flunk out.2. Who will I be voting for in the primaries?The main event: candidates for the Democratic and Republican 2020 presidential nominations.But voters will find all manner of down-ballot elections to consider on primary day, including House and Senate races and seats on the state legislature. You might be voting for the presidents of tomorrow in those contests.3. What's the difference between primaries and caucuses?Primaries are reasonably straightforward: Voters vote, and their votes go to candidates who hope to receive more votes than the other candidates.Caucuses are like this in spirit, but with a dash of municipal sausage-making and D.M.V.-style chaos.Generally, supporters for various candidates sit or stand together in groups. A head count is conducted. And if a candidate doesn't reach a certain threshold of support -- say, 15 percent of attendees at a caucus site -- the group is deemed \"nonviable,\" and its members realign with other clusters before a final count is made.Democracy!4. So when do I vote?Three possibilities:Early voting. Enjoy responsibly! And check out the rules and dates for your state.Election Day voting. The classic! Also varies by state, of course.Your primary was canceled. Better luck next time!5. Can states actually cancel their primaries?They can, and they did!While President Trump would be an overwhelming favorite to win a Republican primary in any state, some of them have decided to scrap the exercise altogether. Trump critics called the moves antidemocratic, but there is bipartisan precedent for such cancellations when a party's incumbent is seeking re-election.6. Is there a Republican presidential primary, officially?Yes, in most states.Mr. Trump's opponents include Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and William F. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts. At present, they are approximately as likely to win as any person reading this sentence. #SentenceReaders20207. Can I vote in both the Democratic primary and the Republican primary?One vote per person, folks.And in some states with so-called closed primaries, you'll need to be registered with a given party to participate.8. Will impeachment affect the campaign?As a practical matter, the impeachment trial in the Senate will keep several Democratic candidates in Washington during crucial would-be campaign days.As an issue for voters, impeachment is not necessarily front of mind. The top Democrats tend to agree that Mr. Trump should be removed from office -- and they also expect the Republican-led Senate to clear him.In recent weeks, voters have pressed candidates much more often on issues like health care and climate than on any allegations of executive high crimes and misdemeanors.9. Could Trump get elected president again, even after being impeached by the House?That's his plan.Mr. Trump is the first impeached president ever to seek re-election. He would like to be the first impeached president to win again.10. I keep hearing this is the largest Democratic field. How big is it, actually?At present, it's 12 deep -- enough to fill a baseball lineup and accommodate a few benchwarmers, too.At its peak, the field swelled well into the 20s, exceeding even the unwieldy 2016 Republican roster and requiring two nights of 10-person debates that nonetheless barred a handful of candidates from the stage.11. Who's likely to win the Democratic nomination?Where's the suspense in telling you now?Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has often led in national polls, but the state-level surveys are more of a muddle. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has raised the most money and retains a loyal core of support from his 2016 run.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend., Ind., have shown strength in Iowa at various points. Betting markets appraise Mr. Biden as the likeliest nominee. They also liked Jeb Bush's chances in 2016.12. Which Democrat has the best chance of beating Trump?For months, Democratic voters have talked constantly about electability.They have had a harder time agreeing on what it means -- or at least, who best embodies it.Biden supporters say the party needs someone who can appeal to white working-class voters who gravitated to Mr. Trump.Some Warren supporters consider this to be a sexist euphemism for an older male nominee, arguing that Ms. Warren's raft of liberal plans can better inspire the masses.Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have suggested that a Midwestern sensibility is best.And Mr. Sanders, whose admirers insist he would have defeated Mr. Trump in 2016 if given the chance, has been perhaps the least subtle at times. A campaign swing planned last year was billed as the \"Bernie Beats Trump\" tour.13. Why do I keep hearing that Iowa is so important?Because Iowa goes first and has since the 1970s.Why? There's no great reason (though the tumultuous 1968 Democratic convention set the stage to an extent), and inertia is a powerful thing. It's sort of like a teacher giving extra credit to the student who comes first alphabetically, except instead of extra credit, it's kind words from national politicians about the good people of Sioux City.Strictly speaking, Iowa awards a relatively small share of delegates (more on that shortly). But winning the state, or even exceeding expectations as a non-winner, can propel a campaign through the rest of the early calendar.14. What's Super Tuesday?Super Tuesday, March 3, is perhaps the most important single date on the primary calendar because of how many major states will be holding their elections, including California and Texas.About 40 percent of all pledged Democratic delegates will be awarded in these states.15. How does someone win the Democratic nomination?A candidate hoping to win on the first ballot at the convention must secure a majority of pledged delegates, as dictated by the outcomes in state primaries and caucuses.In total, there are just under 4,000 pledged delegates up for grabs (as well as hundreds of superdelegates, though the party prefers to call them automatic delegates). The official nomination will take place at the party's convention in Milwaukee this summer.16. What are delegates?Delegates (the people) are political figures like activists and local leaders chosen to represent their states at the party convention.Delegates (the numbers) are the all-purpose metric of primary success, allocated proportionally according to state voting results.Generally, a candidate must exceed 15 percent of the vote in a congressional district or statewide to win delegates.17. What are superdelegates? Didn't they get rid of those?Democratic superdelegates are the political insiders, from sitting lawmakers to former senior party officials, whose primary choices can be divorced entirely from the preferences of workaday voters.Superdelegates can vote as they choose, and their very existence in 2016 became a source of major tension in the race between Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders. While Mrs. Clinton bested Mr. Sanders among pledged delegates in 2016, Mr. Sanders and his supporters saw the superdelegate system as an affront to the democratic process.In response, the Democratic National Committee has sharply reduced the influence of superdelegates, effectively preventing them from participating substantively in the first ballot of the presidential nominating process. But in the event of a deadlock at the convention, superdelegates could come into play.18. Are there any history makers in the presidential election?Ms. Warren or Ms. Klobuchar (or Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii) would be the first woman elected president. Mr. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay person to hold the office.But for all the initial excitement within the party about a deep bench of candidates of color, several -- including Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey and Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary -- have dropped out. The remaining low-polling nonwhite candidates include Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Andrew Yang, a former technology executive.Then there is this bit of potential history: Mr. Sanders (78), Mr. Biden (77), Michael R. Bloomberg (77) and Ms. Warren (70) and would each be the oldest president ever inaugurated for a first term.19. Is there still a chance that a new longshot will emerge?Sure. Just not a great one.There's a cliché in politics: \"The only poll that matters is on Election Day.\" But some other things that matter -- staffing, fund-raising, a workable delegate strategy -- are built well in advance.And many of the lower-tier candidates have been running for many, many months without catching on.A former Maryland congressman named John Delaney has been campaigning for president since the middle of 2017. He has not measurably improved his standing. But perhaps the final weeks will uncover a surge of Delan-iacs who had been keeping their feelings to themselves.20. What's Michael Bloomberg up to?Spending a nine-figure fortune on a possibly quixotic candidacy.But he does have a plan, albeit an unusual one. Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, is effectively skipping the early nominating contests to focus on delegate-rich states that vote in March and beyond. He is already ubiquitous in television ads and has amassed a small army of staff members to sustain his bid for as long as he chooses.Yet he is lagging much of the field in the often-relevant category of \"interactions with actual primary voters.\" And if any candidate emerges from the February states as a clear front-runner, Mr. Bloomberg's time-biding approach could backfire.21. Which party has done better in fund-raising so far?Mr. Trump entered 2020 with more than $100 million in cash on hand and outpaced every Democrat with $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.But contenders for the Democratic nomination have cumulatively surpassed Mr. Trump's total, suggesting intense enthusiasm. Safe to say that neither party's nominee will go hungry this fall.22. Which voters are Democrats targeting?Mr. Biden generally does best with older voters and African-Americans. Ms. Warren is most popular with highly educated Democrats. Mr. Sanders, despite his age, rules the young. And Mr. Buttigieg, 38, despite his age, draws much of his support from a very different demographic.Particularly after Iowa and New Hampshire, which are overwhelmingly white, candidates will be pitching themselves to a much more diverse party electorate. Several candidates, particularly Mr. Buttigieg, have struggled in polls of voters of color. But many campaigns are hopeful that strong showings in the early states will earn them a longer look.23. What issues have dominated the race this year?Health care policy has probably been the most conspicuous, with divisions over the relative virtues of \"Medicare For all\" (one of Mr. Sanders's signature issues) or a more incremental approach.Gun control has come up some, especially after the El Paso massacre last summer.Ms. Warren was often the pacesetter in attention-grabbing proposals, like her bid to break up tech giants such as Amazon and Facebook.Some candidates, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, have turned their attention to the more amorphous issue of national unity: They frame the election as a moment for healing, though no Democrat has identified as anti-healing, exactly.24. Does my vote in the primaries matter?Sure, why not? Nihilism is for Nietzscheans and Knicks fans.And while the piecemeal nature of the state-by-state calendar might make the process seem less exciting than the all-in-one-day general election, the primaries do resolve the nontrivial matter of choosing major party nominees.25. Is it O.K. for me to skip voting in the primaries and just vote in the general election?It's allowed.Of course, candidates tend to call every election \"the most important of our lifetime.\" By definition, that can't always be true. But don't forget the down-ballot primaries, which will be of significant consequence locally in many states.26. Can I vote in the primaries in one state and then the general election in another state?Potentially, if you time it right and change your registration by the fall.And if you happen to be that rare voter moving from an early-voting primary state like New Hampshire to a November swing state like Pennsylvania, well, enjoy the attention.27. Do I need to be registered to vote in the primaries?Forty-nine states require voter registration. (North Dakota, you incorrigible contrarians.)Deadlines can be found here.28. Do I need a government-issued ID?Requirements vary by state. Here's a detailed rundown.29. What if I was removed in a voter purge?Those worried about their status can check here.30. Can I vote over the Internet?Generally, no.Some states allow it in certain (often narrowly defined) circumstances.31. Are Russians going to interfere again?The intelligence community is certainly bracing for it.Despite the president's longstanding doubts about the intelligence consensus on Russian interference in 2016, officials have warned that a sequel of sorts is in the works. After detecting evidence of Russian influence efforts in 2018, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said last year that he viewed the attempts as \"kind of a dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020.\"32. How can I tell this year if Trump's chances of winning re-election are increasing?Historically, the health of the economy is a useful indicator. So are approval ratings.But consulting precedent can be complicated where Mr. Trump is concerned.On the one hand, his party suffered steep midterm losses in 2018 despite low unemployment and many positive economic trends. On the other, Mr. Trump won in 2016 despite often dismal favorability scores.Whether he can repeat the feat might come down to this: Was Mrs. Clinton a uniquely unpopular nominee? Or will any Democrat eventually look beatable once the president and his allies have a single opponent to attack every day?33. Should I trust the polls after 2016?Yes and no.Imperfect polls (which is to say, all of them) are still far more instructive than none at all, if contextualized with care. And while Mr. Trump's 2016 success in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan was a surprise, the popular vote margin -- Mrs. Clinton by a couple of points -- was consistent with much of the late-stage national polling.But of course, the only bulletproof prediction through political history is that people who make political predictions will keep getting things wrong sometimes.34. Are we going to be O.K.?Were we ever, really?35. When is this all over?It's probably best not to think about that. More than 280 days left until general election.Sources: The campaigns (campaign finance); The Green Papers (election calendar and delegate numbers); Ballotpedia (canceled primaries).

Bloomberg -- spilled into public view. There were more pressing matters at hand, including the global spread of the coronavirus and his State of the Union address on Tuesday, but he made little mention of them.Sunday night the president and Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and a latecomer to the Democratic race who is not on the ballot in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, would face off in costly Super Bowl ads. But Mr. Trump, who seems to be increasingly fixated on Mr. Bloomberg and the fortune he is vowing to spend on the election, apparently could not wait.In a tweet sent just after midnight, Mr. Trump tried to implicate Mr. Bloomberg in a conspiracy theory he has used in an apparent attempt to sow divisions in the Democratic presidential field.\"Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldn't do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016.\"More tweets about Mr. Bloomberg followed, culminating in an interview with Sean Hannity, the Fox News personality and presidential confidant, that was taped on Saturday but aired three hours before the game.In the interview, the president reiterated a false claim he had sent in a late-night tweet: that Mr. Bloomberg had demanded a box to stand on should he participate in a Democratic candidates' debate.\"You know, now he wants a box for the debates to stand on. O.K., it's O.K., there's nothing wrong,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You can be short. Why should he get a box to stand on, O.K.? He wants a box for the debates. Why should he be entitled to that? Really. Does that mean everyone else gets a box?\"Mr. Bloomberg's campaign spokeswoman, Julie Wood, did not hold anything back in her response. \"The president is lying,\" she said. \"He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan.\"While he focused on Mr. Bloomberg, the president did not spare any of his Democratic rivals. He and Mr. Hannity played a lightning round where Mr. Hannity invited the president to say whatever came to mind about Democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Mr. Trump falsely called Mr. Sanders a \"communist\" and claimed that he had been married in Russia.\"I think of communism when I think of Bernie,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Didn't he get married in Moscow?\"Mr. Sanders was married in Burlington, Vt., before traveling to the Soviet Union soon after, and the trip has been used as fodder by his critics as evidence that he has communist leanings.During his Fox sit-down, both Mr. Trump and his interviewer seemed more interested in allowing the president to focus on his grievances over impeachment and his re-election effort rather than elaborate on a global public health crisis.\"It's been very unfair from the day I won,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Mostly it was unfair to my family.\"He gave a comparatively cursory amount of attention to the spread of the coronavirus, which caused his administration to bar foreign nationals and Americans who had traveled to China recently from entering the United States.\"We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,\" Mr. Trump said of the coronavirus. \"But we can't have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus.\"Mr. Trump summed it up this way: \"So we're going to see what happens. But we did shut it down, yes.\"Mr. Trump was even less expansive when Mr. Hannity asked whether he had considered moving his State of the Union address, which is scheduled to take place before the Senate impeachment trial officially concludes on Wednesday. The president replied: \"No, I'm going to have it. It's going to be done. We're going to talk about the achievements that we've made.\"\"Nobody has made achievements like we've made,\" Mr. Trump said of his speech, \"so many different things.\"As the game drew closer, the president appeared to once again redirect his focus -- this time to attend the annual Super Bowl watch party he holds at his West Palm Beach golf club. Mr. Trump watched a marching band play \"Born to Be Wild\" on the club's lawn, then went inside to watch the night's competitors -- and perhaps some football -- before departing to Washington.PhotographThe president boarding Air Force One to fly to Florida on Friday.

Now the president is on a Western trip, and basing it in Las Vegas, days before the Nevada caucuses.LAS VEGAS -- President Trump is not exactly a fan of life on the road.He agreed to a four-day Western trip this week on the condition that he spend every night at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. And that location had another attraction: It placed him at the current center of the 2020 presidential race -- Nevada, where Democrats will vote Saturday in caucuses that could reshape the campaign.The trip was meant to showcase the president's aggressive re-election push to drum up funds from high-dollar donors in California, a Democratic state where Mr. Trump is widely unpopular but enjoys some concentrated pockets of support. But the president believes that wherever he goes, he can force the news cycles -- and political fortunes -- to turn in his favor.And the first opportunity to do that was Wednesday night, at the same time the Democrats debated in Las Vegas.\"Should I go to that debate?\" Mr. Trump asked a group of volunteers gathered at his hotel before he left for a high-dollar fund-raiser in Palm Springs, Calif.The president then set off on a hectic schedule that had him hopscotching around California and touching down in Phoenix for a \"Keep America Great\" rally before returning to Las Vegas for the night. And he will hold two other rallies before returning to Washington -- on Thursday in Colorado Springs and on Friday in Las Vegas.Both in private and in public, it was clear that Mr. Trump did not want to cede any political spotlight to Democrats on the debate stage.\"We've seen the polls except some of the fake ones,\" Mr. Trump said in Phoenix. \"If I was treated fairly, we'd be up 20 points higher in the polls. There wouldn't even be a competitive election. Unfortunately, I think it's probably going to be competitive.\"Journalists were not invited to the president's campaign breakfast at his hotel, but a New York Times reporter was dining in the restaurant as a guest. There, Mr. Trump took aim at CNN and MSNBC for reporting on the polls, but saved his special contempt for Comcast, which owns NBC Universal. He called the media conglomerate \"corrupt\" and a \"disgrace to this country.\"Mr. Trump was reacting to several recently released polls, including one by NBC and The Wall Street Journal, that show him trailing several possible Democratic opponents, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\"Internal REAL polls show I am beating all of the Dem candidates,\" Mr. Trump tweeted shortly before leaving for Rancho Mirage, Calif., near Palm Springs, for a private fund-raiser. \"The Fake News Polls (here we go again, just like 2016) show losing or tied.\"One Democrat in particular has held the president's attention: Michael R. Bloomberg. For weeks, Mr. Trump has been preoccupied with Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor and late entry to the Democratic presidential race.\"Is corrupt Bloomberg News going to say what a pathetic debater Mini Mike is,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning, using a nickname to insult Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has recently enjoyed a surge of popularity but who was untested on the debate stage.At his rally, the president again assailed polling in the news media and expressed criticism that Mr. Bloomberg had bought his way into the Democratic race, appearing to fixate on the amount of money the former mayor had spent on his campaign.\"My father would teach me: If you could spend less and win, that's better than spending a lot and winning,\" he told the crowd.Mr. Trump's setting up base in Nevada this week was not the first time he suddenly appeared in the middle of the Democratic Party's nominating process. Last month, he held a rally in Des Moines, four days before the Iowa caucuses.Eleven days later, the president traveled to Manchester, N.H., the evening before the state held its primary election on Feb. 11, though in that case he was on the Republican ballot.\"If you want clear proof of how terrified Donald Trump is, just look at his travel schedule,\" Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on Wednesday. \"He keeps following Democrats from state to state because he knows our message is resonating. Nevada is no exception. Nevadans have rejected this president and his policies, and they're ready to elect a Democrat to the White House.\"In Nevada, it seemed that voters were attuned to Mr. Trump's attempts to wrest attention back to his own campaign.\"It's really disruptive, and in a way it goes hand in hand with his presidency,\" Hillary Steinberg, 56, said at a restaurant in the Las Vegas Arts District. \"His entire presidency has been a disruption, so it makes sense that he would do a rally so close to the primary.\"Rick Van Diepen, an owner of a sustainable architecture consultancy in Las Vegas, said that it was a \"pretty typical distraction,\" but an effective one.\"It's a good tactic to keep his base energized, especially in a state that doesn't have a Republican primary,\" said Mr. Van Diepen, 49. \"It's reminding them that he's here, too.\"But at his rally, Mr. Trump tried to pre-emptively cast doubt on the Nevada electoral process, using the caucus chaos in Iowa as an example. (Technical glitches, among other problems, caused a major delay in reporting the results from the state's first-in-the-national presidential contest.)\"In Nevada I'm hearing bad things about the vote count -- they don't know what the hell they're doing,\" the president said before quickly adding he hoped that was not the case.Aside from the attention-grabbing spectacle of long lines, ample media coverage and cars festooned with Trump-Pence signs driving by candidates' events, Mr. Trump's travels through four states on his Western swing have created a logistical nightmare for some Democratic candidates.At least one campaign complained that Mr. Trump's trip to Las Vegas hampered its Thursday plans, with the flight restrictions that accompany an Air Force One arrival and departure complicating its attempts for travel to more than one other state from now until Saturday.But Justin Buoen, Senator Amy Klobuchar's campaign manager, saw only an upside to the president's presence.\"I haven't gotten any sense that people care about him being here except for that it fires our base up,\" he said. \"I don't think it's hurt coverage of the candidates on cable news networks or even local TV. It hasn't been any kind of distraction.\"Though she rarely even makes mention of the president's current travels, Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, does have a favorite laugh line in her stump speech regarding Mr. Trump's last-minute rallies before the Louisiana and Kentucky governors' elections last year.\"The night before the election in both those states, who went down there to campaign for those Democratic governors as opponents? Donald Trump,\" Ms. Klobuchar has said. \"So my first question is, where can we send him next? Because that went pretty well.\"The Democratic candidates won in both cases.Reporting was contributed by Jim Rutenberg, Reid J. Epstein, Maggie Haberman, Nick Corasaniti and Isabella Grullón Paz.PhotographPresident Trump on Wednesday in Palm Springs, Calif. \"Internal REAL polls show I am beating all of the Dem candidates,\" he wrote on Twitter.

Bolton, then his national security adviser, to help with his pressure campaign to extract damaging information on Democrats from Ukrainian officials, according to an unpublished manuscript by Mr. Bolton.Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the president's impeachment defense.Mr. Trump told Mr. Bolton to call Volodymyr Zelensky, who had recently won election as president of Ukraine, to ensure Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani, who was planning a trip to Ukraine to discuss the investigations that the president sought, in Mr. Bolton's account. Mr. Bolton never made the call, he wrote.The previously undisclosed directive that Mr. Bolton describes would be the earliest known instance of Mr. Trump seeking to harness the power of the United States government to advance his pressure campaign against Ukraine, as he later did on the July call with Mr. Zelensky that triggered a whistle-blower complaint and impeachment proceedings. House Democrats have accused him of abusing his authority and are arguing their case before senators in the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump, whose lawyers have said he did nothing wrong.The account in Mr. Bolton's manuscript portrays the most senior White House advisers as early witnesses in the effort that they have sought to distance the president from. And disclosure of the meeting underscores the kind of information Democrats were looking for in seeking testimony from his top advisers in their impeachment investigation, including Mr. Bolton and Mr. Mulvaney, only to be blocked by the White House.In a statement after this article was published, Mr. Trump denied the discussion that Mr. Bolton described.\"I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of N.Y.C., to meet with President Zelensky,\" Mr. Trump said. \"That meeting never happened.\"In a brief interview, Mr. Giuliani denied that the conversation took place and said those discussions with the president were always kept separate. He was adamant that Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Mulvaney were never involved in meetings related to Ukraine.\"It is absolutely, categorically untrue,\" he said.Neither Mr. Bolton nor a representative for Mr. Mulvaney responded to requests for comment.Mr. Bolton described the roughly 10-minute conversation in drafts of his book, a memoir of his time as national security adviser that is to go on sale in March. Over several pages, Mr. Bolton laid out Mr. Trump's fixation on Ukraine and the president's belief, based on a mix of scattershot events, assertions and outright conspiracy theories, that Ukraine tried to undermine his chances of winning the presidency in 2016.As he began to realize the extent and aims of the pressure campaign, Mr. Bolton began to object, he wrote in the book, affirming the testimony of a former National Security Council aide, Fiona Hill, who had said that Mr. Bolton warned that Mr. Giuliani was \"a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up.\"Mr. Bolton's account matches up with a timeline of other developments in the Ukraine affair. On May 9, The New York Times disclosed that Mr. Giuliani was planning to travel to Ukraine to press for the investigations sought by Mr. Trump, saying, \"We're not meddling in an election, we're meddling in an investigation, which we have a right to do.\" The following day, Mr. Giuliani sent a letter to Mr. Zelensky seeking a meeting later in May \"with the knowledge and consent\" of Mr. Trump.Within weeks, with Mr. Giuliani's request to meet with Mr. Zelensky proving unsuccessful, Mr. Trump would empower a group of American diplomats to work with Mr. Giuliani to continue pressing Ukraine to agree to his desire for the investigations, according to testimony in the House impeachment inquiry.Mr. Trump also repeatedly made national security decisions contrary to American interests, Mr. Bolton wrote, describing a pervasive sense of alarm among top advisers about the president's choices. Mr. Bolton expressed concern to others in the administration that the president was effectively granting favors to autocratic leaders like Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Xi Jinping of China.The Times reported this week on another revelation from Mr. Bolton's book draft: that Mr. Trump told him in August that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter. That account undercuts a key element of the White House impeachment defense -- that the aid holdup was separate from his requests for inquiries. Mr. Trump has denied the conversation took place.Since that Times article, people who have reviewed the draft have further described its contents, including details of the May meeting. Mr. Bolton's manuscript was sent to the White House for a standard review process in late December.Its revelations galvanized the debate over whether to call witnesses in the impeachment trial, but late on Thursday, Republicans appeared to have secured enough votes to keep any new testimony out of Mr. Trump's trial and to move toward a quick acquittal in the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.The White House has sought to block the release of the book, contending that it contains classified information. The government reviews books by former officials who had access to secrets so they can excise the manuscripts of any classified information. Officials including Mr. Trump have described Mr. Bolton, who was often at odds with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr. Mulvaney, as a disgruntled former official with an ax to grind.Mr. Bolton has angered Democrats -- and some Republicans -- for remaining quiet during the House investigation, then announcing that he would comply with any subpoena to testify in the Senate and signaling that he is eager to share his story. Administration officials should \"feel they're able to speak their minds without retribution,\" he said at a closed-door lunch in Austin, Texas, on Thursday, the NBC affiliate KXAN reported, citing unnamed sources.\"The idea that somehow testifying to what you think is true is destructive to the system of government we have -- I think, is very nearly the reverse, the exact reverse of the truth,\" Mr. Bolton added.The Oval Office conversation that Mr. Bolton described came as the president and Mr. Giuliani were increasingly focusing on pushing the Ukrainian government to commit to investigations that could help Mr. Trump politically. At various points, Mr. Trump, Mr. Giuliani and their associates pressed Ukrainian officials under Mr. Zelensky and his predecessor to provide potentially damaging information on the president's rivals, including Mr. Biden and Ukrainians who Mr. Trump's allies believed tried to help Hillary Clinton in 2016.Mr. Giuliani had just successfully campaigned to have the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch, recalled, convinced that she was part of an effort to protect Mr. Trump's political rivals from scrutiny. Mr. Giuliani had argued she was impeding the investigations.At the time of the Oval Office conversation Mr. Bolton wrote about, Mr. Giuliani was planning a trip to Kyiv to push the incoming government to commit to the investigations. Mr. Giuliani asserted that the president had been wronged by the Justice Department's Russia investigation and told associates that the inquiry could be partly discredited by proving that parts of it originated with suspect documents produced and disseminated in Ukraine to undermine his onetime campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, whose work in Ukraine became a central focus of the Russia inquiry.Mr. Giuliani, a private consultant with a range of international clients, had said none were involved in the Ukraine effort, Mr. Bolton wrote, adding that he was skeptical and wanted to avoid involvement. At the time, Mr. Giuliani was working closely with two Soviet-born businessmen from Florida, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, to carry out the shadow Ukraine effort.After pushing out Ms. Yovanovitch, Mr. Giuliani turned his attention to other American diplomats responsible for Ukraine policy. During the Oval Office conversation, he also mentioned a State Department official with the last name of Kent, whom Mr. Bolton wrote he did not know. Mr. Giuliani said he was hostile to Mr. Trump and sympathetic to George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who has long been a target of the far right.George P. Kent, a top State Department official who oversees Ukraine policy, went on to be a key witness in House Democrats' impeachment investigation, testifying that claims by Mr. Giuliani's allies of Mr. Soros' wide influence in Ukraine were used to smear Ms. Yovanovitch.Mr. Bolton left the Oval Office after 10 minutes and returned to his office, he wrote. Shortly after, two aides came into his office, saying Mr. Trump had sent them out of a separate meeting on trade to ask about Mr. Kent, Mr. Bolton wrote.Asked about Mr. Bolton's account, Mr. Giuliani said, \"I think he's making some of it up. He's sure making up -- I wouldn't call it making it up, but he's acting like a real scumbag by never telling me that he objected once, and then saying I was a time bomb, or a firecracker or something.\"The conversation that Mr. Bolton describes was separate from another one that Mr. Bolton wrote about, where he observed Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Trump talking on the phone with Mr. Giuliani about Ukraine matters. Mr. Mulvaney has told associates he would leave the room when Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani were talking to preserve their attorney-client privilege, and his lawyer said earlier this week that Mr. Mulvaney was never in meetings with Mr. Giuliani and has \"no recollection\" of the first discussion.Peter Baker and Kenneth P. Vogel contributed reporting.PhotographJohn Bolton, the former national security adviser, in July. His memoir is set to go on sale in March.

Political prudence demands that he take an exceedingly measured approach to his vote on whether to remove Mr. Trump from office. The senator has spent weeks pleading for open-mindedness, even going so far as to raise doubts about the Democrats' case against the president, saying last month that \"there are gaps.\"The challenge for Mr. Jones is whether voters see him as reasonable and unbiased, as he hopes, or as an appeaser of the other side. His appeals risk alienating not only the Trump-supporting Alabamians he has to answer to when he faces re-election in November, but also liberal Democrats -- his base -- some of whom he says have wanted to remove the president since \"the minute he took his hand off the Bible when he was sworn in.\"In interviews with 20 Alabama voters over the past week, the senator's contemplative approach seems to have persuaded very few. Approve or disapprove of Mr. Trump, they expressed the kind of certainty about impeachment that Mr. Jones will not give them.Impeachment, Skeeter Diehl of Mobile said, \"is a bunch of bull, the whole thing -- just a bunch of noise.\" As Ms. Diehl sat with friends for lunch at Noble South, a bistro downtown, she said Mr. Jones would be smart not to get crosswise with the president and his voters. And she predicted that if he wanted to save his seat, \"he's not going to step out there\" and vote to remove Mr. Trump.But Janelle Finley, a 32-year-old from Mobile who votes Democratic most of the time, was just as resolute in her support for impeachment. She said what mattered most to her when casting a vote was finding a politician whose \"morals match mine,\" and Mr. Trump's decidedly did not. When she considered the case against the president, she saw something larger at risk than the possible loss a Democratic seat in the Senate.\"If Doug Jones goes one way because he thinks it will hurt him in November ...\" Ms. Finley added, pausing to consider the possibility that he might vote not to convict because it could cost him the election. Then she shook her head incredulously. \"After all this evidence?\"\"This is an issue for all of us,\" she continued. \"And right now the world is watching and seeing how divided and broken we are.\"Mr. Jones's predicament represents the flip side of the one facing vulnerable Republican senators in states with less political homogeneity, like Susan Collins of Maine and Cory Gardner of Colorado, where moderate voters might exact retribution for what they view as letting Mr. Trump off the hook.In a brief interview last week, Mr. Jones said he felt the pressure of the impeachment trial every day. \"I mean, this is not something that I bargained for when I ran for this office,\" he said, adding that he could \"really feel the weight of the oath of office and the Constitution on my shoulders.\"He has also called for hearing testimony from John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, after the revelation that a draft of Mr. Bolton's forthcoming book claims that the president wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until officials there helped him with investigations into Democratic rivals.Alabama briefly broke a long cycle of Republican dominance in December 2017 when it elected Mr. Jones, the first time in 25 years that the state sent a Democrat to the United States Senate. At the time, many Democrats and progressive activists held up Mr. Jones's victory as a template for how to be competitive in deeply conservative states.But Mr. Jones capitalized on a unique set of circumstances: the outrage surrounding his opponent, Roy S. Moore, a Trump-endorsed former state judge who had been accused of forcing himself on teenage girls. Mr. Jones, a former United States attorney who prosecuted one of the most notorious crimes of the civil rights era, the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, turned out large numbers of black voters. And he benefited from the support of a smaller number of suburban white voters who were usually reliable Republicans.He won the race by less than 21,000 votes, or 1.5 percentage points, with a boost from traditionally Republican areas like Mobile County, which he carried by 14 points. (In 2016, Mr. Trump won the county by 13 points.)But an unusually high number of votes cast in the race were write-ins for candidates not on the ballot at all -- nearly 23,000 -- suggesting that while many Republicans had turned their backs on Mr. Moore, they could not bring themselves to vote for a Democrat.\"When you have Roy Moore and Doug Jones, for a lot of people it's not 'How do I vote?' It's 'Do I even vote?\"' said Josh Woods, 32, from Mobile.Mr. Woods said he had written in the name of someone else instead of voting for either candidate. As for how he thought Mr. Jones would handle his vote on Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, Mr. Woods said, \"He's well aware of his surroundings.\"Mr. Woods said he did not see himself voting for Mr. Jones in November, given that Republicans were likely to nominate someone more mainstream than Mr. Moore.Without disaffected Republicans to count on, Mr. Jones needs to turn out more Democrats than he did in 2017. But impeachment complicates the race for him either way, putting him in a no-win situation.Karen Dias, a telecommunications executive in Mobile, sat inside a juice store the other day and said Mr. Trump's election had left her deeply shaken. \"I can't even put into words how embarrassed I was,\" she said.If faced with a choice between two Senate candidates who voted to acquit Mr. Trump, she said forlornly, \"What am I going to do?\" before answering her own question: \"I wouldn't vote.\" Noting that in her native country of Brazil people were punished for not voting, she said her conscience would lead her to exercise the freedom she did not have there.In Alabama, Mr. Trump's approval ratings are consistently about 20 points higher than they are nationally, placing it with Wyoming and West Virginia as the states with the highest levels of support for the president.Across much of rural America, the dynamic is similar: The roughly 60 percent of that population that approves of Mr. Trump is demographically distinct from the roughly 40 percent that doesn't.And in Alabama, political divisions are even more closely tethered to race than they are across the rest of the racially segmented South. According to election data analyzed by Seth C. McKee, a political scientist at Texas Tech University, a minuscule number of blacks in Alabama identify as Republicans -- 0.4 percent -- compared with 4.6 percent in the Deep South as a whole. By contrast, 70 percent of whites in Alabama are Republican or Republican-leaning.In the 140-member State Legislature, the parties are split almost entirely along racial lines, with just two white Democrats remaining -- one in the Senate and the other in the House of Representatives.The Republican Party, Dr. McKee said, \"has almost become a counterweight to the black vote in those states,\" with many white voters having come to see it that way. \"The Democratic Party,\" he added, \"is considered the black party.\"On the campaign trail, partisan politics have been wedged into the larger debate over Southern identity. Arnold Mooney, a Republican running to challenge Mr. Jones in November, told a crowd in Huntsville last week that the senator was no Alabamian as far as he was concerned. \"He doesn't represent us, he doesn't look like us, and he doesn't even sound like us anymore,\" Mr. Mooney said, drawing laughter from the crowd. (Mr. Jones does, in fact, still speak with a noticeable Southern drawl.)As Ms. Diehl sat in a group of a half-dozen women at lunch last week at the Noble South, the topic of impeachment elicited eye rolls and groans -- all aimed at Democrats. One of the women, who typically votes Republican, said she had voted for Mr. Jones in the last election but would not do so again. A second, who did not vote for Mr. Jones, said she was not impressed by what she had seen from him so far. \"All he did was fall in with Pelosi and Nadler and the rest,\" she scoffed, referring to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York.In fact, Mr. Jones voted with Alabama's Republican senator, Richard Shelby, 69 percent of the time during his first year in office, according to a ProPublica analysis, but has more consistently opposed Republican policies since. He voted against a permanent ban on using federal funding to pay for abortions, for instance, and opposed Brett M. Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court.At a nearby table, Jan Herndon of Fair Hope said she believed both parties had drifted too far from the center.\"There's nobody who's middle of the road anymore -- and I just want somebody middle of the road,\" said Ms. Herndon, who did not vote for Mr. Moore or Mr. Jones last time. When she thought about what kind of politician fit her centrist criteria, Mr. Jones was not one -- a sign that no matter how pragmatic he tries to sound on impeachment, many Alabama Republicans cannot get past the fact that he is a Democrat.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographSenator Doug Jones, who has taken a contemplative approach to the impeachment trial, risks losing support from voters in Alabama.

His first legislative priority as president was a bill that would have repealed key parts of Obamacare and weakened such protections. His Justice Department is arguing in court that the entire law should be overturned.His tweets Monday morning, describing himself as \"the person who saved pre-existing conditions,\" contradict this record.It is true that Mr. Trump signed a law eliminating the tax penalties for Americans who go without health insurance -- the so-called individual mandate. That provision was one of the least popular parts of Obamacare. But that legislative change has not improved protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions. If anything, it has placed them in jeopardy, by forming the basis of a lawsuit that could erase the Affordable Care Act.Here's a brief history of President Trump's record on pre-existing health conditions.Did he pass the Affordable Care Act?No. The president was not in Washington and not in politics when the Affordable Care Act was written, debated and passed in 2009 and 2010. The health law established consumer protections for Americans who buy their insurance, including a rule that health insurers must offer coverage to anyone who wishes to buy it, with prices varying only by region and the age of the customer.Before Obamacare, some states protected people with pre-existing conditions in this way, but most did not. Americans with prior illnesses like cancer, asthma, even acne, often had trouble buying insurance for themselves and their families. One state that did protect people with pre-existing conditions was New York, where the media executive and presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg currently resides and where Mr. Trump did at the time. (Mr. Bloomberg's recent television advertisements, which attack Mr. Trump's health care record, appear to have prompted the tweets.)The Affordable Care Act was a large and complex law, with many provisions that have proved controversial. But the protections for people with pre-existing conditions enjoy widespread public support.Has he tried to weaken pre-existing conditions protections as president?Yes. President Trump's first legislative priority after his election was to \"repeal and replace\" the Affordable Care Act. Republicans in Congress voted on several different bills, but each of them had provisions that would have substantially eroded the current protections for Americans with prior health conditions, by weakening the regulations that make such insurance available, affordable and useful.The bills would have weakened rules that require insurance to cover a standard set of health benefits, for example, and would have established policies that would have raised prices for people with a history of health problems.Those bills didn't pass, in part because of public concern about the erosion of these popular protections. The Republican-led Senate was unable to muster a majority to vote for any of several repeal bills.The president is also responsible for a number of regulatory changes that critics have characterized as \"sabotage\" of Obamacare. Despite these changes, Obamacare markets have remained fairly stable. But economists and actuaries say that some of the changes, which allow the sale of insurance lacking protections for pre-existing conditions, probably raise insurance prices for sicker customers, if only by a little.Has he supported a lawsuit to erase pre-existing health protections?Yes. The Justice Department filed its latest brief in the lawsuit just last week. If the Trump administration wins the case, all of Obamacare would be declared unconstitutional and eliminated.Such a change would cause many changes and could set off widespread disruption throughout the health system. Among the changes, the protection for pre-existing conditions in Obamacare would go away if the courts agreed with the White House's legal position.The basis of this case is the change to the health law that Mr. Trump mentioned in his tweet. By eliminating the tax penalty for people who do not buy insurance, the White House argues that Congress has made all of the health law legally invalid. So far, a Federal District Court judge in Texas has agreed with this argument. An appeals court in New Orleans is waiting for more analysis to decide whether it agrees, but it has signaled openness to the argument.The president has promised on numerous occasions to release a new health plan, which he presumably would champion should he win in court. But he has never released such a plan or even discussed its broad contours.His silence on concrete policy preferences makes it hard to assess his statement that this plan will \"protect your pre-existing conditions.\" His record so far has not been strong.What about the Democrats?The party has been consistent and united in defense of Obamacare's pre-existing conditions protections. Preserving them was a centerpiece of 2018 midterm campaigns. Democratic state officials and the House of Representatives have intervened in the Obamacare lawsuit to defend the law.Some Democrats support large changes to the health system. \"Medicare for all,\" a proposal endorsed by more than 100 Democratic House members and two major presidential candidates, would reshape the health system by eliminating private health insurance and replacing it with generous government coverage funded with tax revenues. But by providing identical health coverage for every American, this proposal would do nothing that could plausibly weaken access for people with a history of illness.What does this have to do with Michael Bloomberg?Mr. Bloomberg responded to the president's tweets with sarcasm, focusing on the lawsuit.Mr. Bloomberg is blanketing airwaves with an advertisement on his own health care record. The ad opens with a very critical assessment of the president's health care record, describing it as \"threatening coverage for millions of Americans.\"It is worth noting that Mr. Bloomberg also had no role in passing Obamacare. His ad claims credit for cutting the uninsured rate in New York City in half while he was mayor. The main cause of that change was the Affordable Care Act, not any particular action he took.But Mr. Bloomberg has taken no positions that would directly imperil the health law's pre-existing conditions protections. His campaign's health care plan, released recently, would tend to expand insurance access and make insurance more affordable for groups that struggle to buy insurance now. Assessments of various Trump proposals, including legislation that Congress considered and the effects of a legal victory in the lawsuit, support the \"millions\" claim.PhotographPresident Trump during a 2017 ceremony in the Rose Garden after the House of Representatives passed the American Health Care Act, which would have weakened protections for pre-existing health conditions.

Mr. Sanders denounced that theory on Friday.WASHINGTON -- The first version of the conspiracy theory was hatched on Twitter last Friday, Jan. 10.\"Don't rule out that the reason Pelosi hasn't sent impeachment to the Senate is to hurt Warren and Sanders, and to help Biden,\" Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, tapped out on his iPad. \"By timing the trial so it takes place during the Iowa lead-up, she has leverage over the liberals.\"Mr. Fleischer's message was retweeted 1,400 times.Seven days later, Mr. Fleischer's theory that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was attempting to influence the Democratic primary -- for which there is no evidence -- was being promulgated by President Trump.\"They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on Friday, claiming his Senate trial was designed to keep Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Des Moines ahead of the Feb. 3 caucuses.\"Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy Joe Biden, and Bernie is shut out again,\" the president added.An idea that caught fire on Twitter and became grist for Mr. Trump demonstrates how the same echo chamber of right-wing media that boosted him in 2016 is exerting its power again just before the first primary votes are cast in 2020.There was nothing new in terms of the process that got the idea in front of Mr. Trump. But the evolution from online conspiracy theory to Fox News fodder to presidential talking point demonstrated how a world of conservative influencers, Republican lawmakers and online media outlets can drive disinformation through repetition and amplification.Two days after Mr. Fleischer's tweet, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, appeared on Maria Bartiromo's show on Fox News and repeated it. \"This is the dirty little secret nobody is talking about: why the Speaker held these papers,\" Mr. McCarthy said on Sunday. \"This benefits Joe Biden. This harms Senator Sanders, who is in first place and could become their nominee.\"In fact, Mr. Sanders is not the national front-runner for the nomination and never has been, although he had a narrow lead in a recent poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. But Mr. Trump's re-election campaign in recent weeks has been seeking to elevate Mr. Sanders, viewing the self-described democratic socialist as the president's ideal Democratic opponent in November.The Trump camp, in turn, is worried about Mr. Biden's competitiveness against the president in Midwestern battleground states, and would like to do anything possible to trip up the moderate former vice president in his tight primary race against the liberal Mr. Sanders.Mr. McCarthy has continued to repeat the theory and profess support for Mr. Sanders, repeating the talking points in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. His television commentary was then written up by Breitbart News, the right-wing news and opinion site.On Thursday, The Federalist, a conservative website, ran an article with the headline: \"Is Impeachment Delay How Democrats Are Rigging Iowa Against Bernie Again?\" It said Ms. Pelosi's decision to delay impeachment \"provokes the question whether she is deliberately helping Joe Biden.\"One day later, the message had reached the White House, where Mr. Trump, a frequent purveyor of conspiracy theories, presented the idea as a fact.\"It's easy to see why Bernie and his supporters would think the establishment is screwing them again,\" said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, noting that the campaign often looks to Mr. Trump's Twitter feed for its daily message.Conspiracies surrounding Mr. Sanders's political fortunes have been a particular fixation for Mr. Trump, dating back four years. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump circulated the false and unsourced claim that an \"analysis\" -- he did not say who wrote it or where it was published -- concluded that Mr. Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if not for superdelegates, the party leaders and officials who were not bound to vote for the winner of their states' primaries or caucuses.At the time, Mr. Trump and his advisers realized the potential political benefit in lobbing these kinds of accusations. Their campaign, which relied heavily on depressing Democratic turnout as a way to win battleground states like Florida and Michigan, stood to gain by fanning the flames of the rivalry between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton and dredging up the bitterness that many Sanders supporters felt over their loss.Even after winning the election, Mr. Trump continued to claim that Mrs. Clinton had somehow robbed Mr. Sanders of victory. When Donna Brazile, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, released a memoir in 2017, Mr. Trump inaccurately said the book showed that Mrs. Clinton \"bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary\" from Mr. Sanders.In an interview, Mr. Fleischer said he had not seen the idea about the timing of the impeachment trial anywhere else and had not consulted with anyone when he first pitched it on Twitter. \"I just do my best to realistically assess what's happening in Washington,\" he said. Mr. Fleischer said he believed that Ms. Pelosi does not think Mr. Sanders can beat Mr. Trump in November, and that \"she has one big thing on her mind: that's winning the White House.\"He said his tweet took off because \"if it has merit, it starts to gather momentum.\"\"If it has no merit, it's just another tweet,\" he added.Republican staff members on Capitol Hill said the theory gained traction because of a broader narrative -- pushed by Mr. Sanders's own supporters -- that Mr. Sanders was generally getting a raw deal from the mainstream news media and other candidates in the race.In a statement on Friday, in response to a question from The New York Times about the president's conspiracy tweet, Mr. Sanders denounced the theories. \"Let's be clear about who is rigging what: It is Donald Trump's action to use the power of the federal government for his own political benefit that is the cause of the impeachment trial,\" he said. \"His transparent attempts to divide Democrats will not work, and we are going to unite to sweep him out of the White House in November.\"Ms. Pelosi's team has also made it clear she was not trying to meddle in the nominating process.\"Impeachment has nothing to do with politics or the presidential race,\" a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter this week, responding to Mr. McCarthy's accusation. \"As usual, the Minority Leader has no idea what he's talking about.\"On Friday, he added: \"Regardless, Senator Sanders isn't the only senator running, so this doesn't make any sense.\"Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Jeremy W. Peters from New York.A journey from Twitter to Fox News to the president's feed.PhotographPresident Trump claimed without evidence that Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, was \"rigging\" the Democratic presidential primary.

People visiting the capital shared a range of views on impeachment.WASHINGTON -- The impeachment of President Trump has played out like a searing snapshot of the partisan divide, the two parties mostly inhabiting turf so different they might as well be on different planets.We asked Americans visiting the National Mall last weekend to share their thoughts on impeachment. The goal was to see if people's statements broke down as neatly and predictably on partisan lines as the vast majority of the views expressed in Congress.One thing was clear: Almost everyone agreed that impeachment has been a fraught process that has further divided Americans and made them reconsider where we are as a nation. Alas, that may be all we agree on.-- Carol Morasch, 71 --Ms. Morasch is a retired social worker from Fairfax City, Va. Though she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, she is not registered with a party. She came to Washington to protest how the Senate was conducting the impeachment trial.The way everything gets twisted, you know, whatever your belief is, you can make that the truth. So I don't have a lot of hope. And it's sad. That's the frightening thing. I'm 71 and it's sad not to have hope at this age.You know, I was thinking about the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem when we go to the ballgames. And the last line, America, \"The land of the free and the home of the brave.\" And I thought, what happened?And I do think he's going to be re-elected. I'm just afraid for my grandchildren.-- Mike Mullis, 70 --Mr. Mullis is a retired sports administration official from Houston. He is a Republican.I don't think he did anything wrong. If you scrutinized every president and every president's tight-knit circle, could you say something regarding something that happened? There'd be a lot of presidents that would be scrutinized under that. Ultimately, the Democrats are not going to benefit at all.I have always felt good about the country. I think sometimes politics gets in the way of everything that really needs to be done. All the representatives are supposed to represent their constituents, and they really haven't done that, in order to get new legislation done since Trump's been elected. Actually, the citizens of the United States are the ones who have been hurt by this.-- Anthony Williams, 27 --Mr. Williams is an entrepreneur who was visiting Washington from Philadelphia. He said he was \"not a fan of Trump.\"I just felt over all it's kind of sketchy. It doesn't give the American people, or people globally, confidence about where America is headed.I don't think they're giving the trial a chance to play out if they're not bringing witnesses. If you're not bringing witnesses, you have something to hide. So it's very suspicious why they don't want to bring witnesses. Him not bringing witnesses forward is like saying you can hit somebody with your car but get away with it at the same time.-- Ragan Fletcher, 20 --Ms. Fletcher is a sophomore at Belmont University, in Nashville, who is studying music business. She is from Tulsa, Okla., and a registered Republican who said that if the election were today, she would \"vote for Trump.\"I don't think there's enough to convict him for. If it's a question of character, I don't think it's enough for impeachment. I think the Senate's so polarized right now. I don't think the Republicans are going to be willing to impeach him.I feel like, if anything, less hopeful, not more hopeful. It's just upsetting that we're at that place right now where we have to go through a trial in the first place. The fact that we have to go through this as a country isn't a positive thing.-- Jimmy Hadden, 72, and Ollye Hadden, 70 --Mr. Hadden is a veteran of the Vietnam War from North Augusta, S.C., and was in Washington for a funeral at Arlington National Cemetery. Politically, he leans Republican. He voted for Mr. Trump in 2016.Look at the economy, everything is great. I think it's been a sham. It was a basic phone call. We give too much money to foreign countries anyway. He was right to hold it for corruption. I think he's done the right thing. I don't think what he did was corrupt. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were just wasting time.Ms. Hadden also voted for Mr. Trump and said she planned to do so again in November.I think that impeachment has hurt the country because if you can impeach him, I just think it's wrong. We're just glad it's over. We're America. We need everybody to get along. Why can't they?-- Ella Williams, 35 --Ms. Williams was visiting Washington for the weekend from Columbus, Ohio, where she works in information technology. She is an independent who voted for Mrs. Clinton in 2016.I think the G.O.P., they have a lot to lose, and they don't really want to spend the time to invest in a new candidate. I think it will probably hurt Democrats, which is unfortunate to say. I think at this point people just feel like it's a waste of time and a waste of money, and they feel like he's gotten away with so much anyway.At this point I just feel like it's created more division in the country. At this point, the Democrats just need to put their energy behind getting really strong candidates for the 2020 election.-- Lee Gately, 52 --Mr. Gately is a project manager in HVAC sales in Raleigh, N.C. He said he tended to view himself as a \"little bit of a moderate.\"I don't think President Trump did anything wrong. I think he was looking after the taxpayers' dollars on the way they would be spent; he wanted to make sure to spend appropriately. He wanted to make sure it wasn't wasted and involved in any corruption.It's not about the American people anymore. I think the Democrats are just making it all politics. I just want to see more for the American people.-- Kelly Akins, 41 --Ms. Akins is from Norman, Okla., and is an account manager at a software company. She is a Democrat who was in Washington to tour the United States Capitol and witness the impeachment trial.I think that any president and actually any political appointee who uses their office to gain personal benefit and uses resources outside of the government to try to coerce and bribe a foreign government to benefit him and or his election should be removed, and actually never allowed to serve again, in any public capacity.We actually were touring the U.S. Capitol today. We were going to go into the Senate impeachment trial to watch, and I was standing in line. So where have we come to in politics? President Trump and all of the elected officials -- who typically are Republicans -- who support and turn a blind eye to his behavior, his character, the way that he bullies people, it's just we're losing our democracy based on corruption, on bullying from the highest places in office. It's just really sad to me, and I actually was tearing up in the line. I had to leave because I didn't want to witness it. It's just disgusting.-- Sam Riddle, 49 --Mr. Riddle is an equipment company manager based in Charleston, W.Va., who identifies as a Republican.It appears it's completely partisan, mostly hearsay. And what evidence has been available to the general public has not been convincing me at all. I believe that all of the efforts that have been spent on this could have been much better spent on a lot of other issues this country has going on right now, such as the economy, the China trade deals, things President Trump's trying to work on.I think it's been a distraction. I feel like if we all got together and made some compromises and quit building walls between each other, we could probably get a lot more done in this country. It seems harder to do that today than it's ever been. And that part is troubling.-- Angela Peebles, 53 --Ms. Peebles is a cabinetmaker from Prineville, Ore., and identifies as a Republican. She said the impeachment against Mr. Trump -- and overall partisan politics -- had left her worried about the country's future.I don't really think there was anything to impeach him on. No crime. Politics, but no crime. I think it was purely political. And I don't think I'm really right-wing, but I just don't think they proved it. I do think that political favoring is wrong, but I think everybody does that. But I don't think it raised the bar of coercion or bribery. But you're not going to tell me every other president hasn't said, \"Hey, you do this for me,\" you know, the idea?It scares me if we get, let's say, a Democratic president, House and Senate, or something, it just scares me what could happen. I think we're so political now. It worries me that there's not enough reasonable people to compromise. It's your way or the highway lately.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Photograph(PHOTOGRAPHS BY JUSTIN T.

The unexpected turn of events has added a volatile new element to the pitched fight over Mr. Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate.For Republicans, the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the leader of Iran's elite Quds Force, fueled a new line of defense of the president, as they argued that Democrats' effort to oust Mr. Trump while he tended to matters of national security was irresponsible.\"Think of the contrast,\" Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican, wrote on Twitter on Sunday. \"While Democrats are trying to remove President Trump from office, the President is focused on removing terrorists from the face of the earth.\"Democratic leaders insisted the two issues must not be interwoven, and said that lawmakers were obligated to follow through with the impeachment process even as they debated the way forward on Iran. Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday evening told Democratic lawmakers in a letter that the House would act swiftly and vote later in the week on a resolution to limit the scope of the president's war-making powers in Iran.Many of their rank and file have charged that Mr. Trump authorized the strike precisely to distract attention from the charges at the center of his impeachment.\"Congress has to do both of our constitutional responsibilities,\" said Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\"One, to protect the American people and be a coequal branch of government with the administration to make sure that we keep Americans safe,\" he added on NBC, referring to Iran. \"Secondly, we also have to take on the responsibility of what's going to come over at some point from the House, and that's to conduct a full and fair trial.\"Related or not, the rapid developments in recent days mean that Congress will grapple simultaneously in the coming weeks with two of its most consequential constitutional duties: the power to impeach and to weigh matters of war. The outcome will clarify the legislative branch's appetite for checking an expansive presidency and will also likely play a continuing role in Mr. Trump's fight for re-election.The timing and outlook for the president's impeachment trial were already murky. In a pair of votes in December, the House impeached Mr. Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The charges stem from his bid to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, while withholding nearly $400 million of military aid.Ms. Pelosi has refused to transmit the charges against Mr. Trump to the Senate, in a bid to give Senate Democrats more leverage as they try to force Republicans to agree to call administration witnesses and gain access to more documents. The president blocked administration officials from testifying in the House inquiry and refused to turn over documents that impeachment investigators requested, prompting the obstruction charge.Now, the question is whether the coming debate on Iran will affect the calculations by Democrats and Republicans strategizing over the terms and length of a trial.Democrats on the left argue that the impulses that led Mr. Trump to strike General Suleimani are themselves grounds for his removal.\"The issues are connected,\" said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who sponsored legislation to block Mr. Trump from launching an unauthorized strike against Iran. \"It shows the same reckless pattern of policymaking that he engaged in with Ukraine. It's no longer a matter of standing up for the rule of law and the Constitution. This is a matter of safeguarding our national security and peace because a president that disregards constitutional processes can pose a huge risk to stability and peace.\"Senators spent the year-end holidays preparing for the impeachment trial, a showdown over the fate of Mr. Trump's presidency that could consume parts of January and February.Lawmakers and aides close to Ms. Pelosi say she has not yet made up her mind on how or when to proceed, and said foreign policy would not affect her thinking. A decision could come as soon as this week, when House lawmakers reconvene on Tuesday and the speaker holds a series of meetings with her leadership team.But the strike on the Iranian general was preoccupying many lawmakers. Some Democrats, calling the action unauthorized and illegal, made clear over the weekend that they intended to try to curtail Mr. Trump's ability to strike Iran in the future. After the White House on Saturday sent Congress an unusual, completely classified notification of the drone strike, Ms. Pelosi said it raised \"serious and urgent questions\" about the decision.\"Congress and I will do everything I can to assert our authority,\" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Sunday on ABC. \"We do not need this president either bumbling or impulsively getting us into a major war.\"But in a clear signal that he has no interest in consulting with Congress on his military moves or strategy, Mr. Trump suggested on Sunday that lawmakers should monitor social media to discern how he plans to proceed.\"These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner,\" the president tweeted. \"Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!\"Senators are expected to receive a full briefing from administration officials in the coming week on the strike. An all-members briefing in the House has yet to be scheduled, according to a senior Democratic aide.\"As members of Congress, our first responsibility is to keep the American people safe,\" Ms. Pelosi said in a letter announcing the war-powers vote. \"For this reason, we are concerned that the administration took this action without the consultation of Congress and without respect for Congress's war powers granted to it by the Constitution.\"Senators could be forced to vote on a similar resolution as soon as mid-January.That timing could collide directly with an impeachment trial, an all-consuming proceeding that brings other Senate work to a halt.Though they did not explicitly connect the two issues, Republicans have begun looking for ways to force Ms. Pelosi's hand and move the trial along. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said on Sunday that he would seek a long-shot change to the Senate rules to compel the House to bring its case forward so it could be dispensed with quickly.\"If we don't get the articles this week, then we need to take matters in our own hands and change the rules. Deem them to be delivered to the Senate,\" he said on Fox News.In an interview on Sunday evening, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 House Republican, said that the strike \"puts more pressure\" on Ms. Pelosi to put aside impeachment and focus on \"things that really matter.\"\"It's time to let the Senate do its job and move on because there are real, significant issues that the country is facing right now -- both foreign and domestic,\" Mr. Scalise said.Democratic leaders insisted on Sunday that Congress owed it to the country to air what they believe are serious charges of high crimes and misdemeanors against Mr. Trump. They chastised Republicans, saying they were seeking to use the threat of war to paper over the president's wrongdoing.\"It's complicated, but I do think they are separate responsibilities,\" Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, said in an interview. \"And while the president may hope that there is some effort to set aside the impeachment while we try to figure out how to avoid going to war with Iran, we have to do both at once.\"Across the political spectrum, Democrats' response to the escalation in Iraq and Iran underscored the deep mistrust between their party and Mr. Trump. Some liberal lawmakers have begun questioning whether Mr. Trump's decision to kill General Suleimani could have been influenced by his desire to neutralize the impeachment threat against him.\"It is a reasonable question to ask, particularly when the administration, immediately after having taken this decision, offers a bunch of contradictory explanations for what's going on,\" Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, one of the Democrats vying for her party's nomination to challenge Mr. Trump, said Sunday on CNN.Liberals like Mr. Khanna may also push the debate toward a place Ms. Pelosi had sought to avoid by conflating specific impeachment charges the speaker argues are separate from Mr. Trump's other behavior with foreign policy decisions they do not like.About a dozen progressive advocacy groups planned to converge on the Senate daily beginning on Monday to demand Mr. Trump's removal from office, rallying not just around the charges against him but against military escalation.For now, at least, the debate over the procedures of a Senate trial has continued on its own track. With his counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, unwilling to negotiate, Mr. Schumer on Sunday began explicitly appealing to a handful of moderate Republicans who Democrats believe could join them in voting to call witnesses once the trial begins.\"McConnell will not go for a fair trial,\" Mr. Schumer said on ABC. \"You can't have a fair trial without witnesses and documents, particularly those that were right at the scene of the charges. But four Republican senators can join us.\"PhotographAfter the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, Senator Chuck Schumer, left, said that Democrats would try to curtail the president's ability to strike again.

Without evidence, he said that an increasing number of Americans were \"disgusted\" by congressional Democrats who, he said, are \"obsessed with demented hoaxes, this crazy witch hunt and deranged partisan crusades.\"\"They've spent the last three years and probably even before I came down on that beautiful escalator with our beautiful future first lady,\" Mr. Trump said, \"trying to overthrow the last election, and we will make sure that they face another crushing defeat in the next election.\"The president traveled to Wildwood, a boardwalk town on the southern end of the Jersey Shore that is deserted in the winter, to return a political favor for Mr. Van Drew, a former moderate Democrat who last month switched parties and pledged his \"undying support\" for Mr. Trump. Mr. Van Drew had also been a strong anti-impeachment voice in the House before he made the switch, saying the Republican Party was a \"better fit.\"Mr. Van Drew said he had requested a rally when Mr. Trump asked how he could help.\"They're trying to steal that election,\" Mr. Trump said, \"and Jeff had the guts to defy the left-wing fanatics in his own party and to stand tall in defense of our Constitution, our freedom and democracy itself.\"At the rally, Mr. Van Drew was immediately embraced by Trump supporters as one of their own. Mr. Trump lost New Jersey by 14 points to Hillary Clinton, his Democratic challenger in 2016, but the rally drew thousands who hope to change the political fortunes for local Republicans, starting with Mr. Van Drew's re-election.\"He has the conservative values that we want,\" James Toto, a councilman in Somers Point, N.J., said as he joined the line outside. \"He has conservative values more so than some Republicans do. He wants to make sure people can be independent and on their own.\"Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, said that campaign officials were betting that Mr. Van Drew represented the type of politician that moderate Democrats might want to hear more from.\"We think a lot of Democrats across the country are looking for a new home,\" Mr. Murtaugh said at the rally.Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, a former 2020 presidential candidate, said the opposite in a fund-raising email sent to supporters of his Senate re-election campaign.\"Trump will be spreading his platform of hatred and bigotry to help re-elect Jeff Van Drew, the congressman who shamefully switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican during the impeachment process,\" the email said.The rally location -- essentially empty in January -- gave attendees an opportunity to bundle up and engage in a spiritual takeover of the area for a few days. Beachside motels opened up to board an influx of supporters.On Monday evening, the Trump faithful overran local bars, singing renditions of \"Sweet Caroline\" late into the night. Hundreds of people were lined up outside the Wildwoods Convention Center, staking out their claim to the front of the line with plastic chairs. Near the boardwalk, Trump-themed recreational vehicles were parked in the shadow of dormant roller coasters.\"There is nobody in the middle of winter,\" the president remarked, \"and those streets are packed all the way back to the airplane, probably.\"Mr. Trump, who on his way out of Washington did not stop to answer questions as his impeachment defense team wrapped up its case in the Senate, used his time at the rally podium to fight back -- and to train the spotlight back on his own re-election campaign. He promised that his campaign would be signing up \"millions and millions\" of registered independent and Democratic voters, and bragged about his poll numbers.\"I had the best polls that I've ever had since being elected,\" he said, \"the best we've ever had. Remember, I used to go over polls, but I only used to talk about them when I was doing well otherwise.\"The president's approval rating has hovered at around 43 percent, but an increasing number of Americans are voicing support for hearing witnesses in his impeachment trial.Mr. Trump is facing several roadblocks in his administration's quest for a speedy acquittal in the Senate. His former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, wrote in a book draft that Mr. Trump had held up aid to Ukraine to further his political ambitions, making it harder for Senate Republicans to abstain from requesting that witnesses offer further testimony.On Tuesday evening, cracks in the united front that the White House has tried so hard to build with Senate Republicans started showing when Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told a closed-door meeting of Republicans that he did not currently have the votes to block Democrats from calling witnesses at the trial.While he targeted the topic of impeachment at times, calling out individual Democrats like Speaker Nancy Pelosi by name, Mr. Trump's hourlong address largely hewed to the same red-meat themes he has introduced to his base.\"I never even knew the swamp was this bad,\" Mr. Trump, who frequently attends high-dollar donor events, told the rapt crowd. \"A lot of bad people in the swamp. Bad people in the swamp.\"Mr. Trump introduced several inaccurate claims, including falsely accusing the Obama administration of choosing not to end the AIDS epidemic -- even though President Barack Obama directed billions to accelerate efforts to find a cure.He also claimed that the Republican Party would protect patients with pre-existing medical conditions. \"We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will,\" said Mr. Trump, whose administration has taken steps to weaken such protections.PhotographPresident Trump held a rally in Wildwood, N.J., as a favor to a congressman who switched parties.

His entourage passed through the capital, Addis Ababa, where Beijing has built highways and factories, and financed a metro system and a multibillion dollar railway to neighboring Djibouti.On Tuesday, Mr. Pompeo met the chairman of the African Union at its towering headquarters, built and paid for by China at a cost of $200 million.Almost two years since President Trump named him America's top diplomat, Mr. Pompeo has traveled to Africa to convince its leaders to shun Chinese investments and, instead, look to Washington and American companies for collaboration.But he has come to Senegal, Angola and Ethiopia without offering any major new American government investment, initiatives or assistance. Instead he promoted American companies, boasting that their practices are superior and motives purer when compared to China's.\"When we come, we hire Angolans,\" Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference in the Angolan capital, Luanda. \"We do high-quality work. It's transparent.\"\"Not every nation that comes here to invest does that,\" Mr. Pompeo said. \"There's no political objective.\"Mr. Pompeo's efforts to contain China's role in Africa come as the Trump administration is sending mixed signals about its engagement with the continent.Amid growing extremist violence, the United States is weighing proposals to reduce or completely pull out its forces from West Africa, drawing sharp criticism from both allies and lawmakers.In early February, President Trump announced an expanded travel ban that now affects nearly a quarter of Africa's 1.2 billion people -- including Nigeria, the continent's biggest economy and its most populous nation.As both China and Russia step up their presence and investments, the United States has proposed cutting aid and development funding to African states -- which still dwarfs that of China and Russia. President Trump himself has also faced censure for reportedly calling African states \"shithole countries,\" drawing outraged responses across the continent and potentially harming strategic American interests.The Trump administration's Africa policy has focused almost exclusively on countering the influence of China and Russia, said Aubrey Hruby, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Africa Center.While previous American presidents sent mixed cues about their depth of commitment to Africa, Ms. Hruby said, they also had signature programs that reflected their visions. This included Barack Obama's initiative to boost electricity access, George W. Bush's program to address the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic, and Bill Clinton's signing of the landmark African Growth and Opportunity Act in 2000, a cornerstone of the U.S.-Africa trade relationship.The Trump administration, she said, is yet to find \"a positive focus to promote in Africa.\"Over the past two decades, China has deepened its reach in Africa, financing large infrastructure projects like roads and a railway in Kenya, opening up a military base in Djibouti, deploying peacekeepers in South Sudan and Liberia, and spreading its culture and language by funding Confucius Institutes across the continent.The first trip that China's foreign minister takes each year is to Africa, and other senior Chinese officials regularly visit countries across the continent to solidify relations. African leaders themselves have often trooped to Beijing. Paul Kagame, the president of Rwanda, described the partnership between Africa and China as not just \"equal\" but \"a revolutionary posture in world affairs.\"Since Mr. Trump took office, African leaders look at America and see signs of its neglect. Over three years, Mr. Pompeo and his predecessor Rex Tillerson have visited fewer than ten African countries -- a decline from the nearly two dozen African states visited by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who served under President Obama for four years.In light of this, \"U.S. government officials just don't seem to understand that talking trash about the Chinese in Africa, regardless of its merit, just does not help their cause,\" said Eric Olander, co-founder of a research initiative, The China Africa Project.In addition, Mr. Pompeo's suggestion that Chinese companies operating in Angola do not hire locals was not accurate, Mr. Olander said, noting that locals got a majority of the jobs on Chinese projects.Beijing has been accused of offering cheap, no-strings-attached loans to African governments that are in dire need of financing to boost their economies -- with the sting of default coming when those nations can't repay those debts. China critics and Western officials, including Mr. Pompeo himself, have said these lending programs amount to a \"debt trap,\" pose a risk to the sovereignty of African states, and could push debt limits to unsustainable levels. Chinese officials have fervently denied these claims, and cast their engagement with Africa as a win-win.In Angola, which is in the midst of a massive corruption scandal involving the former president's daughter, Mr. Pompeo railed against the \"destructive\" nature of corruption and its impact on ordinary people. Yet analysts say that this message may ring hollow among Africans well aware that President Trump just underwent an impeachment trial and has been accused of steering U.S. government business to his own hotels and resorts.But it may be that Mr. Pompeo's trip will convince some African leaders that the Trump administration is now ready to focus on Africa. His visit, said Addisu Lashitew, a research fellow with the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington, \"testifies to a modicum of interest in the continent\" and signals a step toward resetting the relationship with Africa in anticipation of President Trump's re-election.This is especially true in the choice to visit Ethiopia, a strategic American ally that is undergoing sweeping changes under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. A fast-growing economy, Addis Ababa plays a critical security role in the Horn of Africa, is home to the African Union, is liberalizing its economy and privatizing key sectors like telecom. The country has extensive relations with China, but has engaged the United States in trying to resolve a dispute with Egypt over a dam that Ethiopia has built on the Nile.American officials traveling with Mr. Pompeo said on Tuesday they were encouraged that Mr. Abiy hasn't deviated from his commitment to reforms, and commended his efforts to renegotiate Ethiopia's debt with China.Besides the two secretaries of state, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump have visited Ethiopia in the past three years, demonstrating the country's ongoing significance no matter the American administration, Mr. Lashitew said.While \"Chinese finance and investment is far from perfect,\" Mr. Lashitew said, \"it is not fair\" that Mr. Pompeo ask African leaders to choose between the U.S. and China. \"If the U.S. is a genuine development partner of Africa, it must respect the right of African countries to partner with any other country that can help them grow their economies, including China,\" he said.In trying to compete with China in Africa, Ms. Hruby said that the United States should focus on sectors where it has unique advantages, including education, finance, media and entertainment. The N.B.A.'s push into Africa, for instance, could act as a tool to attract support in Africa.\"In terms of building U.S. influence in African markets and enhancing brand USA,\" Ms. Hruby said, \"Black Panther,\" the superhero film based on the fictional African nation of Wakanda, and \"the new N.B.A. Africa league have done far more than a handful of cabinet level trips ever could.\"Simon Marks contributed reporting from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.PhotographSecretary of State Mike Pompeo with the prime minister of Ethiopia, Abiy Ahmed, on Tuesday.

Yet by promising a vaccine \"soon,\" the president almost certainly misled at least some of the public into thinking a solution to the outbreak was just around the corner.In confronting the first major health crisis of his presidency, Mr. Trump has made himself the primary source of information to the public with mixed results. Appearing before cameras sometimes multiple times a day to talk about the coronavirus, he has offered a consistently rosier assessment of the situation than health experts and has put forth unproven or even false assertions.He originally claimed that his travel restrictions on China would \"shut it down,\" preventing the spread of the virus to the United States, and he has undercounted the number of infections as they have emerged. He has suggested that the virus would most likely \"go away\" by spring, a prediction born more of hope than knowledge. And he has minimized any economic effects.\"The market's in great shape,\" he said after stocks plummeted on Tuesday.At times, Mr. Trump has been corrected, gently but unmistakably, by the health experts standing next to him at the microphones. On Tuesday, they brought him to the National Institutes of Health for a tour and a Virus 101 seminar of sorts, flashing slides on a screen to make points they wanted him to absorb and repeat to the public -- including the timetable for a possible vaccine that, while fast for this sort of drug development, remains in the distance.\"This isn't political, left-right, this is a scientific thing,\" said Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, the vice provost of global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania and a health policy adviser to President Barack Obama. \"The politicians are learning on the job. Let the experts talk about it. They're the definitive ones and don't make statements that have no basis in fact or are extrapolations of fact that aren't reasonable.\"Over the past week, Mr. Trump at times has seemed to follow some of that advice, appearing with experts and inviting them to take the microphone. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the renowned director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has joined the president for public statements and denied that he has been muzzled.But Mr. Trump has made clear he will be the main voice on the coronavirus. He addressed it publicly four times on Tuesday alone, while cameras were barred from the daily briefing by Vice President Mike Pence, who is managing the response along with Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services.\"I think it's fair to say that President Trump has struggled, and that's not surprising,\" said Matthew Seeger, a dean at Wayne State University who has written extensively on crisis communications. \"One of the real challenges we've seen is a tendency to over-reassure. There is a tendency for us to say, 'Don't worry, everything is going to be fine, don't panic.\"'Mr. Trump and his allies said the problem was the other way around, that the president's critics were too eager to proclaim doom and gloom for the purpose of hurting him politically as he headed into his re-election campaign. The president last week went so far as to call Democratic criticism the \"new hoax,\" although he later stressed that he did not mean that the outbreak itself was a hoax.\"Unfortunately, what we are seeing from the left and some in the media is a disgusting effort to distract and disturb the American people with fearful rhetoric and palace intrigue,\" said Judd Deere, a White House spokesman. \"The coronavirus is a serious situation that is changing hourly, which is exactly why Vice President Pence, Secretary Azar and the entire task force continue to lead a whole-of-government response.\"At the start of the crisis in China, Mr. Trump acted quickly and decisively to curb travel from there to the United States, a move that Dr. Fauci said on Tuesday had \"really saved us a lot of hurt.\"But the president at first overstated how effective it would be, boasting to reporters last month that he had \"pretty much shut it down coming in from China.\"It is unclear exactly how the virus entered the United States and whether it was carried from China, but Mr. Trump may have left the impression that he had successfully cut off its path into the United States.Mr. Trump has also misstated the number of Americans with the virus. He said on Saturday that 22 people in the country were infected, but at that time, 70 cases had been reported. He also incorrectly described the first United States citizen to die of the virus as \"a wonderful woman,\" when the victim was actually a man. (The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later tweeted that Mr. Trump had been given inaccurate information.)The president has theorized that the virus is likely to dissipate during warm weather. \"A lot of people think that goes away in April with the heat -- as the heat comes in,\" he said. \"Typically, that will go away in April.\" Many health experts say that it is true of some strains of influenza and may be possible in this case, but that too little is known about the coronavirus for such predictions.At a news conference last week, the president spoke with an optimism that even then appeared misguided. Asked whether schools should prepare for the virus's wider spread, Mr. Trump played down the prospect. \"I don't think it's going to come to that,\" he said, \"especially with the fact that we're going down, not up. We're going very substantially down, not up.\"\"We have it so well under control,\" he added.More recently, Mr. Trump has taken to suggesting that drug makers are making rapid progress toward a vaccine. \"They're moving along very quickly. All of the pharmaceutical companies are moving along very quickly,\" he said on Saturday and then repeated similar sentiments on Monday after meeting with drug company executives.But health officials caution that, even under the best circumstances, a vaccine would most likely not be available for widespread use before mid- to late-2021. Dr. Fauci made a point of emphasizing that more than once on Tuesday, using the slide show at the National Institutes of Health to demonstrate that while safety trials on a vaccine will begin soon and progress has been strikingly fast compared with past health crises, it will take considerable time to move to mass production if it proves safe.\"Very soon, we'll be sticking the first person with the vaccine,\" Dr. Fauci said at a later appearance with the president after landing by helicopter back at the White House. \"But I want to caution everybody: That's only the first stage of the development of the vaccine.\" Over all, he said, \"the whole process is going to take a year, a year and a half at least.\"Mr. Trump did not quarrel with that, but urged Dr. Fauci to tell reporters about the progress toward \"therapeutics\" that will combat the infection once a person has it.Dr. Fauci noted that two large trials for such medication are underway in China and the United States that could move more quickly than a vaccine. \"That may take three months. That may take five months. I don't know,\" he said. \"When the trial is over and they evaluate the data, if the drug works, then you'll be able to apply it.\"With fears of the coronavirus sending waves of concern through the country, Mr. Trump has focused as much on the economic consequences as the medical ones. He repeatedly demanded that the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to bolster the economy, but when the central bank did so on Tuesday, investors were unimpressed and markets tumbled another 3 percent.Some critics have complained that the administration's message on the markets has been ill considered. Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House National Economic Council, has urged Americans to \"buy the dip,\" saying that \"stocks look pretty cheap to me.\"But some of his predecessors said such boosterism of markets from the White House set a dangerous precedent. \"Making these kinds of confident assertions about the unknowable will always lead to substantial errors that undercut officials' credibility,\" said Larry Summers, who held Mr. Kudlow's post under Mr. Obama and served as Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton. \"This is one kind of high-order blunder.\"The White House has bristled at the criticism, seeing it as insincere point scoring. Seeking to push back, Mr. Pence's office has begun compiling praise for the administration's handling of the crisis and sending it out to supporters and news organizations.\"Shame on Dems for trying to play politics with the Coronavirus,\" Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second-ranking Republican in the House, wrote on Twitter in a message circulated by the White House. \"The health and safety of Americans should be everyone's top priority. Period.\"Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump visiting the National Institutes of Health's vaccine research center in Bethesda, Md., on Tuesday.

Gen. Qassim Suleimani could reshape the contest.The American strike in Baghdad that killed the Iranian general Qassim Suleimani thrust foreign policy to the center of the Democratic presidential race, drawing expressions of grave concern from the leading candidates and stoking a new debate in the party about the American military presence in the Middle East.The party's presidential field reacted to the attack with a measure of unity, at least on the surface level, condemning General Suleimani's role directing violence against Americans but criticizing what they called the Trump administration's penchant for reckless action and the threat of all-out war.But during a series of campaign events on Friday, the top Democrats began to signal their differences on matters of national security, opening the way for what could become the party's most serious conversation of the race about war and peace. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose long diplomatic résumé and global stature have been seen as crucial assets to his campaign, seized the occasion to remind voters of his experience, pressing them to elect a president who could \"command the world stage with no on-the-job training.\"Delivering stern remarks in Dubuque, Iowa, Mr. Biden said President Trump was risking nuclear proliferation and \"direct conflict with Iran.\" On Twitter, he described the president as \"erratic, unstable and dangerously incompetent.\"\"The threat to American lives and interests in the region and around the world are enormous,\" Mr. Biden said in Iowa.But elsewhere in the state, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called not just for the replacement of an impulsive president but for a wholesale overhaul of American foreign policy in the Middle East. Opening a town-hall-style meeting in Anamosa, Iowa, with a somber address, Mr. Sanders urged a total military pullback from the region and noted at length that he had forcefully opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, without explicitly mentioning that Mr. Biden had voted to authorize the war.\"We need to firmly commit to ending the U.S. military presence in the Middle East in an orderly manner, not through a tweet,\" Mr. Sanders said, reiterating his past calls for a pullout from Afghanistan and an end to cooperation with Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. \"Instead of provoking more volatility in the region, the United States must use its power, its wealth and its influence to bring the regional powers to the table to resolve conflicts.\"And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who in the past has urged a pullout of all American combat troops from the Middle East, echoed that sentiment on Twitter, warning that the country was \"on the brink of yet another war\" and urging Americans to mobilize against military escalation. \"No more Middle East Wars,\" she wrote.Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren used the word \"assassination\" to describe the killing of General Suleimani, a term that has significant legal and diplomatic implications. One of the prominent centrists in the race, Michael R. Bloomberg, rebuked Mr. Sanders for that description, calling it \"outrageous.\" He described the felled general as a fair target, questioning instead whether Mr. Trump was prepared for the fallout.Whether military matters come to dominate the primary, in the remaining month before the Iowa caucuses, is likely to depend on events in Iraq and Iran -- and perhaps in neighboring countries -- and how severe and visible any ensuing clash with Iran turns out to be. Foreign affairs have so far played a strictly limited role in the Democratic race.There have been major debate-stage duels over health care, taxation, immigration, criminal justice and gun control, but only glancing disagreements about the role of the United States abroad and the proper way to resolve American military engagements in the Middle East and Central Asia.On Friday, much of the Democratic field proceeded with -- and recommended -- caution. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called on the Trump administration to consult with Congress about a \"strategy for preventing a wider conflict. \"And in North Conway, N.H., Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., called the Baghdad attack \"an extremely provocative act,\" noting that Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had both considered but opted against attempting to kill General Suleimani.\"If we have learned nothing else from the Middle East in the last 20 years, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you are ready for what's coming next,\" said Mr. Buttigieg, who referred several times to his own service in the military.The possibility of a new and protracted conflict abroad could well reshape the general election, even beyond the Democratic race. Mr. Trump ran for president on a pledge to pull back the United States from foreign wars, drawing support from unconventional quarters for a Republican because of the perception that he would pursue an \"America First\" policy of relative isolationism and national self-interest.But Mr. Trump had already drawn criticism from his Democratic rivals, and even within his own party, for presiding over a chaotic pullback from Syria, and the eruption of large-scale violence in Iran and Iraq could profoundly complicate his aim to seek a second term on a message of peace and prosperity. After Thursday's attack, the Trump administration announced that thousands more troops would deploy to the region in anticipation of Iranian action.At Democratic campaign events on Friday, there was already a strong ripple of anxiety running through the primary electorate, as voters who turned out to see several candidates voiced alarm as they imagined what Mr. Trump might do next.\"Nobody wants war, and that's what I am afraid of, is that there is going to be war,\" said Brenda Bachman, a 63-year-old from Marengo, Iowa, who had come to see Mr. Sanders. \"We don't need war.\"Ross Mercer, 37, a disabled Navy veteran in New Hampshire who served two tours in Iraq, said at Mr. Buttigieg's event that he was worried about Iranian retaliation.\"We attacked their country first and I'm scared that they're going to come back and attack our country,\" Mr. Mercer said.There is some precedent for events overseas reshaping American primary elections, often to the benefit of a candidate regarded as a figure of experience -- in this case, perhaps Mr. Biden. In December 2003, the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq formed a backdrop for the final phase of a Democratic presidential primary that yielded the quick nomination of John F. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Four years later, in 2007, the troop surge in Afghanistan and the December assassination of a former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, in Pakistan pushed national security to the center of an unsettled Republican primary that ended with the nomination of John S. McCain, the war hero whose campaign focused overwhelmingly on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Kevin Madden, a political strategist who advised Mr. Bush and Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns, said national security tended to become an election issue in response to major external developments. He cited the Benghazi attack in the fall of 2012 and the Paris nightclub massacre in 2015 as other recent examples.\"Every recent contest has had one of these events,\" Mr. Madden said, \"where everything seems to stop and cause all the participants, from the candidates and campaigns to the voters and the media, to recalibrate the stakes of the election through the lens of national security and foreign policy.\"But an intensifying debate over foreign policy could have the effect of both spotlighting Mr. Biden's extensive track record in the Middle East and subjecting it to new scrutiny. There have been signs in recent days that several of the leading Democratic candidates were angling for a foreign policy debate with Mr. Biden, even before the outbreak of violence in Iraq and the Suleimani killing came to consume the news.Mr. Sanders has campaigned consistently on his antiwar record, and he has repeatedly highlighted Mr. Biden's past support for the Iraq war, warning Democrats that Mr. Trump would use that record against the former vice president in a general election. On Friday morning, an aide to Mr. Sanders posted images on Twitter showing the progressive lawmaker speaking out against war in Iraq in 1991, 1998, 2002 and 2014.Mr. Biden told reporters in Iowa on Friday that he would not respond to Mr. Sanders's criticism, calling it \"ridiculous\" and countering that Mr. Sanders had his own \"baggage.\" He did not specify what he meant by that.Mr. Buttigieg, meanwhile, has attempted to counter questions about his own relative inexperience by pointing to Mr. Biden's stances on Iraq, as an example of how experience was not always an asset in campaigning or governing.\"He supported the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime, which was the decision to invade Iraq,\" Mr. Buttigieg said in an Iowa television interview.Mr. Sanders's speech on Friday also indicated how he might use foreign policy to separate himself from other senators who are running for president: He pointed out that he has voted against all of Mr. Trump's military budgets, a distinction that Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar cannot claim.It is impossible to predict precisely how an extended debate over foreign affairs might alter the dynamics of the Democratic race. On Friday, some voters said they yearned for a candidate with Biden-like credentials, while others said they wanted one with a Sanders-like aversion to war.\"I don't think it would have escalated to this point if he was the current president,\" Craig Bruxvoort, a 62-year-old Iowa voter, said of Mr. Sanders.At Mr. Biden's event in Dubuque, Karen Sudmeier, a retired teacher, said she had begun the day considering several options -- including Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg -- but after hearing Mr. Biden speak about the Middle East she had decided to support him.\"Joe knew everything about it,\" said Ms. Sudmeier, 72. \"He had a plan. And the consequences he laid out of what could happen, I thought, were frightening.\"Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting from North Conway, N.H., Sydney Ember from Anamosa, Iowa, and Katie Glueck from Dubuque, Iowa.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., far left, denounced President Trump's decision to approve a military strike in Iraq on Friday, describing Mr. Trump as \"dangerously incompetent.\" Senator Elizabeth Warren, middle, and Senator Bernie Sanders also criticized the move from the campaign trail.

Bolton, about tying military aid for a foreign ally to his own personal agenda, as senators consider the president's future in the Oval Office.\"I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,\" Mr. Trump wrote just after midnight, referring to a widely debunked theory that the president had pursued about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter.In an unpublished manuscript of his upcoming book, Mr. Bolton described the White House decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine until he left the White House in September. As national security adviser, Mr. Bolton would have been involved in many of the high-level discussions about Ukraine.Mr. Bolton's account directly undercuts one of Mr. Trump's defense arguments, that the frozen funding was not connected to his petitioning of Ukraine's leader, President Volodymyr Zelensky, to help him in the 2020 presidential election by announcing an anticorruption investigation into the Bidens.The new details come at a time when senators approach making a final decision -- possibly by the end of the week -- on whether to allow new evidence and new witnesses, like Mr. Bolton, to be introduced in Mr. Trump's trial in the Senate. Mr. Trump's defense team started presenting his defense on Saturday and has through Tuesday to argue against his removal from office.\"There can be no doubt now that Mr. Bolton directly contradicts the heart of the president's defense,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said in a joint statement on Sunday after The New York Times's article about Mr. Bolton's account was published.Hours after his midnight posts, Mr. Trump falsely stated that the Democrats never asked Mr. Bolton to testify during the House impeachment inquiry last year. Republicans and Mr. Trump's defense team have argued that to call witnesses at this stage in the impeachment proceedings amounts to Democrats telling the Senate to do the work the House did not.Mr. Trump also falsely claimed that his White House released the critical military aid to Ukraine ahead of schedule.Democrats have been pushing the Republican-led Senate to allow new witnesses, including possibly Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who played a key role in the Ukraine pressure campaign. There were few signs by the end of last week that any Republicans would vote with Democrats on the matter.But Mr. Bolton's account about Mr. Trump's motivations for freezing the military aid appeared to further sway at least two Republican senators -- Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- to consider hearing new testimony.\"I think it's increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton,\" Mr. Romney told reporters on Monday.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and one of the president's biggest supporters in the Senate, said if Democrats call witnesses, Republicans should be able to as well. Republicans have been clamoring to hear from Mr. Biden and his son about their ties to Ukraine, which Mr. Trump has called corrupt.By Monday morning, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and Mr. Graham had pressed the White House for an explanation of Mr. Bolton's account.Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Bolton's manuscript was provided to the National Security Council and edits to it had not been seen or made by anyone else in the White House.\"That is something that we have kept walled off for obvious reasons,\" Ms. Grisham said Monday on Fox News. \"Just could be a conflict with the trail going on, so it's nothing that I've seen and nothing that I know about in terms of what they would remove for national security.\"Fred Fleitz, Mr. Bolton's former chief of staff, called on him in an opinion piece for Fox News to immediately withdraw the book from the publisher.Mr. Bolton's lawyer blamed the White House for the disclosure of the book's contents, which Mr. Bolton submitted for a standard security review 12 days after the House impeached Mr. Trump. It is possible that the submission of Mr. Bolton's book to the White House deepened desires to keep Mr. Bolton from testifying.In his manuscript, Mr. Bolton describes an effort that he had made, along with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, to push Mr. Trump to release the aid. Mr. Bolton said he also spoke with Attorney General William P. Barr about his concerns over the parallel diplomacy with Ukraine led by the president's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani. Mr. Barr, whom Mr. Trump mentioned in his July phone call with Mr. Zelensky, has tried to distance himself from Mr. Giuliani and the Ukraine matter.Bob Driscoll, a lawyer for Mr. Mulvaney, disputed Mr. Bolton's account and said Mr. Bolton was merely trying to sell his book, which is set to be released in mid-March.Mr. Bolton, who has said he would testify at the Senate trial if he was subpoenaed, wrote in the manuscript that Mr. Pompeo told him privately that there was no basis to criticize the American ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Career diplomats have testified that there was no justification to fire Ms. Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani and two of his associates had been pushing Mr. Trump to fire her since the spring of 2018.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump at the White House on Friday.

Officials were also expected to consider new rules that would further curtail the ability of Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, to have access to American technology, including semiconductors.But on Tuesday, Mr. Trump seemed to scuttle such moves. Two people familiar with the matter said that the late February meeting was on hold and that the United States would not block G.E.'s ability to sell jet engine parts to China.\"The United States cannot, & will not, become such a difficult place to deal with in terms of foreign countries buying our product, including for the always used National Security excuse, that our companies will be forced to leave in order to remain competitive,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"We want to sell product and goods to China and other countries.\"\"As an example, I want China to buy our jet engines, the best in the World,\" he said in another tweet. \"I have seen some of the regulations being circulated, including those being contemplated by Congress, and they are ridiculous.\"Speaking on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Mr. Trump insisted that he cared deeply about America's national security but suggested that the term was being wielded too broadly and at the expense of the U.S. economy.\"I think people were getting carried away with it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I want our companies to be allowed to do business,\" he added, referring specifically to chip-makers, which have complained about lost sales to Huawei, a large buyer of American semiconductors. \"Things are put on my desk that have nothing to do with national security.\"Mr. Trump said that he had been \"very tough on Huawei\" but that he wanted American companies \"to be able to sell all of this incredible technology.\"The about-face is the latest blow to the China hawks in the Trump administration and another win for more moderate advisers like Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has been pushing for greater accommodation of Beijing amid pressure from corporate America.The administration's efforts to restrict the flow of American technology to China has triggered objections from companies, who say it undermines their ability to compete on a global scale. Foreign firms have already taken steps to limit the American components in their products over concerns that access to parts they need could be cut off. And some American companies say they may begin to do more research and development outside the United States to avoid running afoul of the administration's stricter China rules.General Electric, in response to media reports on Saturday about the administration's review of its export license, said in a statement that it would comply with any requirements imposed by the United States but played down concerns about the risks of sales to China.\"We aggressively protect and defend our intellectual property and work closely with the U.S. government to fulfill our responsibilities and shared security and economic interests,\" General Electric said in a statement. \"G.E. has provided products and services in the global marketplace for decades.\"The potential U.S. restrictions have gotten China's attention.Geng Shuang, spokesman for China's foreign ministry, criticized the U.S. proposal to halt the jet engine deliveries during a news conference on Tuesday.\"It would expose certain U.S. officials' ignorance in science and technology, disregard of the market principle, and anxiety with China's development,\" he said during a briefing. \"It will be another example of the U.S. using political means to undermine bilateral commercial cooperation and wantonly oppress China.\"Mr. Trump's description of national security as an \"excuse\" for interfering in international commerce is surprising given the president's decision to routinely link economic and national security. Mr. Trump has cited the need to protect national security in his decision to impose tariffs on foreign metals and to consider placing them on foreign autos. The U.S. has also cited national security in expanding its ability to block international mergers and acquisitions.The shift in position is also notable given the administration's ongoing efforts to crack down on Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that is on a government blacklist. Administration officials were expected to further restrict American sales to Huawei by closing a loophole that has allowed technology companies like Intel and Micron to continue shipping chips, software and other products to Huawei. While the Pentagon initially opposed the tighter rules, fearing it could hurt defense suppliers, it has now reversed its position under pressure from other administration officials.That reversal came amid tougher words toward China from top Trump administration officials, who in recent days have expressed growing concern about China's technology dominance.Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper assailed China for stealing technology and then developing its own systems to dominate critical sectors.\"Huawei and 5G are today's poster child for this nefarious activity,\" Mr. Esper said.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took the criticism of China a step further at the conference, referring to Chinese state-backed technology companies as \"Trojan horses for Chinese intelligence.\"It appeared that Mr. Trump shared that sentiment. Richard Grenell, the American ambassador to Germany, said on Twitter on Sunday that the president had just called him from Air Force One and asked him to make clear that \"any nation who chooses to use an untrustworthy 5G vendor will jeopardize our ability to share Intelligence and information at the highest level.\"But Mr. Mnuchin -- a close confidante of Mr. Trump who has repeatedly warned against pursuing draconian measures that would stifle business and inhibit the United States economy during an election year -- appeared to have influenced the president's decision.The Treasury Department had no comment.Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises the Trump administration, said that Mr. Trump's comments reflected the president's focus on increasing trade, boosting jobs and making Americans wealthy.\"The president has been clear about wanting American companies to get rich in China,\" Mr. Pillsbury said. \"President Trump frequently says he doesn't want China to surpass us but he never said he wants to put them out of business or be vindictive.\"On Tuesday, business groups cheered the shift in tone, which came suddenly and took some by surprise.\"We applaud President Trump's tweets supporting U.S. companies being able to sell products to China and opposing proposed regulations that would unduly curtail that ability,\" John Neuffer, president and chief executive of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said in a statement. \"As we have discussed with the administration, sales of nonsensitive, commercial products to China drive semiconductor research and innovation, which is critical to America's economic strength and national security.\"Jacob Parker, senior vice president of the US-China Business Council, said that the administration was notorious for giving mixed messages on such policies and that he was hopeful that the White House would put out a formal notification that the tighter rules affecting companies that sell components to Huawei are off the table.\"We hope that the message that this is undermining the ability of companies to invest in long-term research and development is beginning to resonate with those in the administration,\" Mr. Parker said.However, signs that Mr. Trump is softening his stance on China could draw backlash from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers who have been urging him to keep pressure on Beijing.\"The Chinese Communist Party is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to supplant the United States and our critical industries by stealing intellectual property and through state-owned or state-directed enterprises,\" said Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida. \"The United States must ensure our current export controls are sufficient to prevent handing over sensitive technologies to Beijing.\"Julian Barnes and David McCabe contributed reportingPhotographTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is among those who have been pushing to accommodate Beijing.Word count: 1398Show lessYou have requested \"on-the-fly\" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

New polls offer insights, not answers.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Giovanni Russonello, your morning newsletter writer taking over your afternoon edition.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.At Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate, the candidates bickered and battled over health care policy; over Michael Bloomberg's record and his right to represent a party that he only recently rejoined; over the possible dangers of nominating a democratic socialist.But in a way, it all seemed like just window dressing around one big question: Who has the best chance in November? Every policy critique seemed to lead inexorably back to this issue of electability.In his very first comments at the debate, Mr. Bloomberg didn't just criticize Senator Bernie Sanders's plan to create a single-payer health care system -- he said it would cause Democrats to lose the general election.\"I don't think there's any chance of the senator beating President Trump,\" Mr. Bloomberg said. \"You don't start out by saying I've got 160 million people, I'm going to take away the insurance plan that they love.\"Mr. Sanders shot back, arguing that Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, was \"a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\"\"If that's a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised,\" Mr. Sanders said.A wide majority of Democratic primary voters have said in poll after poll that they care about finding someone who can win the general election more than finding a candidate who agrees with them on the issues.But who is that candidate? It's far from clear.Until recently, Democratic voters tended to see former Vice President Joe Biden as the strongest option. But after he failed to place in the top three in either Iowa or New Hampshire, he lost any veneer of invincibility. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday showed that for the first time in the race, Democrats are most likely to name Mr. Sanders as the candidate with the best chance to beat Mr. Trump.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's approval rating has risen, most likely lifted by the strength of the economy and his acquittal in the Senate's impeachment trial. His Gallup approval rating hit 49 percent this month -- the highest number of his presidency. So while a majority of Americans still disapprove of him, he has the potential to win at least as much support as he did in 2016, when he lost the popular vote but pulled off a decisive win in the Electoral College.The ABC/Washington Post poll showed that in head-to-head matchups with all six of the candidates onstage at the debate, Mr. Trump would earn between 45 and 47 percent of the vote nationwide. The Democrats' shares varied from 49 to 52 percent. The differences between each Democrat were all within the poll's margin of error.This suggests that, despite Mr. Sanders's claim that a \"political revolution\" would be needed to drive turnout, and in spite of his more moderate rivals' argument that his left-wing proposals would alienate a huge swath of voters, any Democratic nominee would probably have a good chance of winning the popular vote.But Republicans have won the Electoral College three times this century, even though they have won the popular vote only once. So what really matters is who can beat Mr. Trump in a handful of key swing states.That's why Quinnipiac University asked voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- three states that Mr. Trump narrowly flipped in 2016, giving him an Electoral College win -- to choose between the president and each of the six leading Democratic candidates.The data from those polls suggests that Mr. Trump is in a very strong position to win Wisconsin, a heavily white state that was once solidly blue but has trended conservative over the past 10 years. None of the six leading Democratic candidates finished ahead of Mr. Trump there.Conversely, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, he didn't have a lead against any of them. Mr. Biden beat Mr. Trump by eight percentage points in Pennsylvania -- where he was born -- and by four points in Michigan. Mr. Sanders was up by five points against the president in Michigan, and by four points in Pennsylvania. Mr. Bloomberg led Mr. Trump by six points in Pennsylvania, and by five points in Michigan.The other three candidates included in the poll -- Senator Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth Warren -- generally fared a little less strongly, though Ms. Klobuchar had a strong, seven-point lead over Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, and none of them were behind him there or in Michigan.A University of North Florida poll released this week found meaningful differences between the candidates' chances in that state. Mr. Bloomberg beat Mr. Trump by six points among registered Florida voters, thanks in part to the strength of his support among voters with college degrees, according to the poll. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, both hobbled by relatively weak support from black and Latino voters, each finished four points behind the president.Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both ran neck-and-neck with Mr. Trump.Like all surveys, head-to-head polls are not actually able to predict the future. They simply show what might happen if the election were held today. A lot will change over the course of the campaign.Still, what happens in these bellwether states will determine the election -- so you can expect these kinds of head-to-head polls to be more common as the primary season rambles on, and as Democrats continue to fret over their chances to take down Mr. Trump.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .From Opinion: The trickiness of electabilityIn this new weekly feature, our colleagues from The New York Times's Opinion section will share expert analysis and perspectives from across the political spectrum. In today's installment, there's more to read about why electability is so unpredictable.There is a home base that all the conversation about the Democratic presidential primary comes back to in the end: Primary voters prioritize, above all, someone who can defeat President Trump.In any election that features an incumbent president, the main goal of the out-of-power party is to nominate a candidate well-suited to defeating the incumbent. That's why both Republican Party elites and less enthusiastic conservative voters got behind Mitt Romney after a series of polls in 2011 showed he was the only Republican beating President Barack Obama in head-to-head matchups.This year, Democrats' desire to replace the incumbent has reached a fever pitch, arguably higher than it's ever been for either party. But paradigm-shifting presidents have complicated the idea of electability, as Adam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff for Senator Harry Reid, pointed out this week in an Op-Ed.Mr. Obama won his first election despite being a \"black man who had admitted to using cocaine, who was caught on tape calling working-class whites 'bitter' people who 'cling to guns and religion,' and who sat in the pews with a pastor who declared, 'God damn America',\" Mr. Jentleson said.Mr. Romney, the Republicans' supposed safe bet, lost despite running against the sluggish economy under Mr. Obama.And Hillary Clinton, another supposed safe bet, lost to Donald J. Trump.So does anyone know what electability even means anymore? Our columnist Bret Stephens believes that \"of course Bernie can win,\" but also thinks that the current front-runner's democratic socialist vision may be disqualifying for many voters: \"For some of us, none-of-the-above is a viable option. For far too many others,\" he writes, Trump will \"be the devil they know.\"-- Talmon Joseph SmithThanks for reading.

But there were also no limitations placed on Mr. Trump's ability to transfer funds from Pentagon accounts. The administration has now allocated more than $18 billion for Mr. Trump's border wall.The funding would allow the administration to complete more than 880 miles of border wall by 2022, the officials said. But Mr. Trump is still far behind on his promise to deliver 450 miles of wall by the end of this year. Just last Friday, the acting homeland security secretary celebrated the completion of 100 miles of border wall, much of it on land already owned by the federal government.\"The wall system you see behind me is an undeniable impediment to smugglers, traffickers and other criminals who have exploited our lack of effective border infrastructure to smuggle drugs, illicit goods and engage in human trafficking,\" the acting secretary, Chad Wolf, said on Friday.Mr. Trump's pursuit of a border wall picked up momentum last Thursday when a federal appeals court allowed the administration to use $3.6 billion in military construction funds, a move that delayed or suspended 127 military projects. The ruling overturned a decision by an El Paso judge who had found that Mr. Trump's emergency proclamation, which allowed him to obtain the military funds, was unlawful.\"Multiple courts have already ruled that President Trump has no authority to take billions from service members for his xenophobic wall,\" said Dror Ladin, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project. \"The A.C.L.U. won't rest until the president's illegal power grab is blocked once and for all.\"The plans to transfer more funds from the Pentagon, first reported by The Washington Post, reaffirm that Mr. Trump is likely to again center his campaign on the border wall, a project that was initially used as a mnemonic device to remind him to focus on immigration at 2016 presidential campaign rallies.Mr. Trump faces other impediments for his construction, including an investigation into a $400 million contract for wall construction awarded to Fisher Sand & Gravel by the Office of Inspector General for the Defense Department. The company's chief executive, Tommy Fisher, has repeatedly pushed for the wall on Fox News, the president's favorite news channel, which has helped others win senior positions in the Department of Homeland Security.Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, has taken a lead role in Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and specifically the construction of the wall. Mr. Kushner has held meetings with military leaders to discuss moving money to Mr. Trump's border wall.But money is not the only obstacle: Even as the administration secures funding for the wall, the potential path of the project still runs through land the government does not own.Mr. Trump has encouraged officials to use eminent domain powers to seize land from private landowners. But many owners of land in the wall's path are fighting the federal government in court, a process that delayed previous administrations' efforts to construct border barriers for years.PhotographPresident Trump in September in Otay Mesa, Calif.

They are voters who wear tasteful crepe blouses and carry structured Kate Spade totes, who like how their 401(k)'s are performing but say they could do without President Trump's \"temperament.\"They are members of one of the most coveted groups in electoral politics: suburban women. But in their field of vision, Mr. Gardner, Colorado's top Republican officeholder, is almost nowhere to be found.\"I don't hear him speaking out on things,\" said Jennifer Gremmert, 50, the executive director of an energy nonprofit. She is the kind of voter who could help Mr. Gardner win re-election in November, a registered Democrat who considers herself \"nonpartisan,\" \"not that enthusiastic\" about her party's Senate candidates, and \"totally\" open to Mr. Gardner. But when it comes to the bipartisan stands that Ms. Gremmert said she prized in a candidate, \"I don't see him.\"On one level, this is strange: Many of these voters were crucial to Mr. Gardner's narrow Senate victory in 2014, when he carried the suburban vote and was ahead among independents, according to exit polls. And they may be even more essential to him now -- he is widely considered to be one of the most at-risk G.O.P. senators seeking re-election this year.But Mr. Gardner's invisibility -- he hasn't held a town hall-style meeting in two years -- is also pragmatic, a means of avoiding questions about his ties to the divisive president, especially as the Senate impeachment trial nears. If Mr. Gardner ends up vocally supporting the president, or votes to acquit him in the trial, it will complicate and perhaps even endanger his race to hold onto his seat.Unlike most Republican senators, Mr. Gardner has been largely mum on the articles of impeachment against the president and the Senate trial starting Tuesday. Early in the process, he called the impeachment inquiry a \"total circus,\" but notably refused to answer questions about whether the president's conduct with Ukraine had been appropriate.Mr. Gardner hasn't indicated one way or the other whether he'd vote to subpoena witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial, even as some other senators facing tough re-election fights, like Senator Susan Collins of Maine, have expressed an openness to doing so. Last week on Capitol Hill, he evaded reporters eager to pin down his thoughts, his handler hurrying him into the nearest elevator. On Thursday evening, when a local Colorado reporter caught him at the Denver airport, a smiling Mr. Gardner offered still no clarity. \"We have a trial,\" he said. \"That's where we're at right now.\"While Ms. Collins and some other senators open to calling witnesses have been critical of the president at times, Mr. Gardner is far more circumspect about Mr. Trump, and relies heavily on Republicans and conservatives for votes -- people who are intensely loyal to the president.But if Mr. Gardner is going to win in 2020, in a state that votes Democratic in presidential elections, he is also going to need voters like the women who joined Ms. Gremmert for lunch on a recent Friday in Denver's Greenwood Village. They consider themselves moderate Republicans and likely to support Mr. Gardner, but want to hear him make a case for himself and his record.\"I think his presence is being overshadowed by Donald Trump,\" lamented Sandra Hagen Solin, a 51-year-old Republican who runs her own lobbying firm. \"He needs to get his message out.\"That message, many Republicans insist, is a strong one. Mr. Gardner's supporters often note how in the last four years, he has had more legislation signed into law than the rest of Colorado's congressional delegation combined. But such is the trade-off, perhaps, of Mr. Gardner's disappearing act: While it allows him to sidestep uncomfortable questions about the president, it also prevents him from aggressively promoting the record that Republican strategists believe he can win on.Dick Wadhams, a veteran Colorado Republican operative, was not bashful about calling out Mr. Gardner's fear of public exposure. \"If I had one criticism of him,\" Mr. Wadhams said, \"it's that his team keeps him locked up in a fortress.\" (Mr. Gardner and his aides did not return multiple requests for comment.)Impeachment has served only to highlight Mr. Gardner's silence, whether on his own record or the national issues du jour, according to other Colorado Republicans. His caginess has frustrated some Trump supporters in Colorado, whose votes Mr. Gardner will almost certainly need to prevail in November, when Democrats are likely to come out in force in the presidential election.\"I think he wants to please everybody, but he needs to be more transparent,\" Angela Carr, a 44-year-old flight attendant, said at the Denver Republican Party's recent monthly breakfast.Ms. Carr, who said she became a Republican \"because of Trump,\" recalled the October day that Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina introduced a resolution condemning the House impeachment inquiry. \"We're watching all the other Republican senators sign on it, and we're like, 'O.K., Cory ...\"' she said. \"And he finally did toward the end, but you kind of want to see your guy or gal more out there.\"She and others at the Denver breakfast acknowledged the political considerations that prevent Mr. Gardner from mirroring the approach of a Southern lawmaker like Mr. Graham on impeachment. In 2016, Mr. Trump lost Colorado to Hillary Clinton by just under five percentage points. In 2018, Democrats swept every statewide office in Colorado in what was largely seen as a rebuke to Mr. Trump's administration. And now, Mr. Gardner, according to Morning Consult, has an approval rating of just 36 percent.But many Republicans were quick to point out that Mr. Gardner is no stranger to long-shot races and the complicated political dynamics that come with them.In 2014, Mr. Gardner, then a congressman, challenged Senator Mark Udall in a race where \"Cory was seen as a dead man walking,\" according to Tyler Sandberg, a Colorado Republican operative. The reason: Just two years earlier, President Barack Obama had beaten Mitt Romney in the state by more than five points.But Mr. Gardner won his seat in 2014 by 2.5 percentage points, or about 50,000 votes, in a year when Republicans flipped nine Democratic-held seats nationwide and took control of the Senate. He was able to do so in large part, Mr. Sandberg said, \"because he refused to let himself be pigeonholed into something he wasn't.\"In his campaign, Mr. Udall sought to characterize Mr. Gardner as an extreme social conservative, which Mr. Gardner -- in a steady stream of television ads, digital media and public appearances -- consistently pushed back on.It's an approach that Republican strategists believe would work well in this environment, too, as some Democrats try to portray him as too pro-Trump and some conservatives say he is not pro-Trump enough.\"I'm confused as to why he's not out on the stump more, because that's what he was so good at in 2014,\" Mr. Sandberg said.In addition to not holding a town hall event since August 2017, Mr. Gardner has no upcoming events listed on his Facebook page. In an August 2019 editorial, The Greeley Tribune, which serves Mr. Gardner's former congressional district, criticized the senator for his dearth of public events. \"Gardner has been largely absent during the past five years when it comes to being available for his constituents, to whom he needs to be accountable,\" the editorial board wrote.And on impeachment, he has rankled even local talk radio hosts for dodging interviews. In late November, Steffan Tubbs, who hosts a Denver station owned by the conservative broadcast company Salem Media, told his viewers that Mr. Gardner's team had declined a request to interview the senator about \"the impeachment inquiry, campaign, and Thanksgiving plans.\" Mr. Tubbs, who called Mr. Gardner \"a friend,\" criticized the senator for his \"crickets\" during \"a very critical time in this administration.\"Some Republican voters sympathize with Mr. Gardner's predicament. In his last town hall event, which was his first in a year, Mr. Gardner was all but shouted offstage by liberal protesters as he tried to explain his efforts to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act.\"I don't blame a senator or congressman for trying to find another way to engage that's actually productive and collaborative,\" said Debbie Brown, the president of the Colorado Business Roundtable, who considers herself a moderate Republican.But other observers think he missed an opportunity, if only to make a point about liberals like those who shouted him down. \"I thought Cory should have held one town hall after another right away, then stopped them on the grounds the left was so asinine,\" said Lynn Bartels, a former longtime political reporter in Colorado.Mr. Gardner's supporters are optimistic that once voters hear the extent of his record \"separate from Trump,\" as Ms. Solin put it, his stance on the president will matter less. His supporters point to his yearslong effort to relocate the Bureau of Land Management from Washington, D.C., to Colorado, which the administration has announced as officially underway. They also promote his work with Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren to allow cannabis businesses access to the banking industry in states like Colorado, where marijuana is legal.Mr. Gardner is likely to end up facing John Hickenlooper, the former Democratic governor now running for Senate, in the general election, and he will probably maintain many Republican votes -- even if cast grudgingly.At the recent Denver G.O.P. breakfast, where some people wore \"Make America Great Again\" and \"Keep America Great\" hats, but where Mr. Gardner's campaign was limited to a leaflet, Herb Glasser, a 54-year-old public accountant, said he planned to support Mr. Gardner despite resigning himself to being \"unhappy\" with the senator a long time ago.\"We have no choice,\" said Mr. Glasser, who described himself as a \"true conservative.\"According to Mr. Sandberg, the G.O.P. operative, it's now up to Mr. Gardner's campaign to reach those Coloradans who, despite their disdain for the president, might still be persuaded to give his party a chance.Voters, perhaps, like Amy Conklin. Ms. Conklin, a former Littleton City Council member, is a registered Democrat, but says she has long \"put out yard signs for both sides.\" She was a legislative aide when Mr. Gardner was a member of the state House, and remembers him as \"a really good legislator,\" someone who \"would reach across the aisle.\"Her feelings since have changed. \"I've been intensely disappointed in his behavior since he's gone to Washington,\" she said.Ms. Conklin conceded that Mr. Gardner had done some good work in the Senate. But what looms largest in her mind, what she says she'd be hardest pressed to forget, are a handful of photographs she's seen of Mr. Gardner, including one from last winter, in which she described him as \"smiling and waving, following Trump out of Air Force One.\"PhotographCory Gardner of Colorado is widely considered to be one of the most at-risk Republican senators seeking re-election this year.

Hours before, Speaker Nancy Pelosi had warned that anything short of a full trial with new witnesses and evidence would abet Mr. Trump's attempts to cover up wrongdoing.As the subject of the charges on trial, Mr. Trump has no direct say over how the Senate proceeds and, by all accounts, Republicans do not have the votes needed to dismiss the case as Mr. Trump suggested, at least not before hearing opening arguments.But the remarks could put lawmakers from his party in a difficult position in the weeks ahead if they have to justify to constituents loyal to the president why they are even giving a hearing to a case he derides as a \"sham.\"And the zigzagging underscored the challenge facing Mr. Trump's defense team and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, as they try to navigate competing interests just days before the trial is to begin. Mr. McConnell has said he intends to run a trial similar to the 1999 impeachment proceeding against President Bill Clinton, meaning both House prosecutors and Mr. Trump's defense team will be given a chance to present their arguments.Mr. Trump's running impeachment commentary came on a day when much of Washington was busy preparing for the trial, only the third such proceeding in American history. Ms. Pelosi has said the House will send the two articles of impeachment charging Mr. Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress sometime this week, with a trial commencing as soon as Wednesday.Appearing Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" before Mr. Trump's tweet, Ms. Pelosi told senators considering forgoing a full trial that \"dismissing is a cover-up\" and asserted that whatever the outcome, the trial could never \"erase\" the stain of impeachment from Mr. Trump's record.Even as the speaker expressed optimism that the House's three-month impeachment inquiry had collected enough evidence to win a conviction on its two charges, she implicitly acknowledged the difficulty Democrats would have in doing so. And she warned that the Senate proceeding might be little more than a cover-up if Republican senators did not agree to summon new witnesses and documents that Mr. Trump blocked from the House.\"We have confidence in our case that it's impeachable, and this president is impeached for life, regardless of any gamesmanship on the part of Mitch McConnell,\" the speaker said, referring to Mr. McConnell.The House impeached Mr. Trump last month on two counts related to what Democrats concluded was a campaign by the president to pressure Ukraine to investigate his domestic political rivals, including by withholding as leverage a White House meeting and nearly $400 million in vital military aid from the country.\"There's nothing,\" Ms. Pelosi said, \"the Senate can do that can ever erase that.\"The comments appeared to be an acknowledgment that given the highly polarized state of the nation and the Senate, there was little chance that the two-thirds of senators needed for conviction and removal would agree to do so. They also foreshadowed a likely election-year strategy by Democrats, who are prepared to argue that voters should serve as an appeals court on Mr. Trump's fitness for office.\"They take an oath to have a fair trial, and we think that would be with witnesses and documentation,\" Ms. Pelosi said. \"Now the ball is in their court to either do that, or pay a price for not doing it.\"Before he called for a dismissal of the case, Mr. Trump appeared to be piqued by Ms. Pelosi. He suggested on Twitter questions for Ms. Pelosi to answer on air and later responded to her statements about his legacy.\"Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did NOTHING wrong?\" he asked in one tweet, after her appearance, adding, \"Very unfair to tens of millions of voters!\"In other posts, Mr. Trump repeated familiar attacks on the speaker and Representative Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat and House Intelligence Committee chairman who oversaw the impeachment inquiry and is likely to lead the prosecution in the Senate. Both Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schiff, he said, ought to be witnesses during the impeachment trial, a common argument among Republicans who believe the two lawmakers have mishandled their duties in their conduct of the impeachment inquiry.Congressional Republicans close to Mr. Trump also pounced on the speaker's prediction, arguing that it betrayed the Democrats' true motivation throughout the impeachment process: to build a case, any case, to slime Mr. Trump's re-election campaign before the November election.\"Remember this, next time they try to pretend they were 'prayerfully' or 'reluctantly' impeaching @realDonaldTrump. They weren't,\" Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, wrote on Twitter. \"It was all about trying to politically damage the President.\"Ms. Pelosi unexpectedly withheld the articles in a bid to increase pressure on Republican senators to commit to calling witnesses, without whom Democrats privately concede they have no shot of even coming close to a conviction. Though she relented without winning any commitments from Republicans, the speaker argued on Sunday that she had succeeded in showing the public \"the need for witnesses.\"Republican senators have already challenged the speed and exhaustiveness of the House's inquiry, and questions about the strength of the evidence it gathered and witnesses it did not secure are likely to be front and center as the trial gets underway.Under the rules Mr. McConnell intends to adopt, senators will eventually be able to vote on whether to call witnesses or other evidence, but there is no guarantee they will do so. Mr. McConnell has made clear that he wants a narrow and speedy trial, and that he does not foresee any chance of a conviction.It would take only four Republican senators to break ranks and join Democrats to secure the majority needed to compel the new testimony -- though even that may not be a guarantee.\"I don't expect anything, but I don't think it's impossible,\" said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination to take on Mr. Trump this fall, when asked about possible Republican defections.The most animated witness fight may be over John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser who said last week that he would be willing to testify in the trial if called by the Senate and even if the White House ordered him not to. Other impeachment witnesses and people close to him say that Mr. Bolton was deeply alarmed by Mr. Trump's actions toward Ukraine and, as one of his top aides, has relevant, firsthand information to share with lawmakers.Ms. Pelosi said on Sunday that she had not \"excluded\" the possibility that the House could subpoena Ms. Bolton to testify, but indicated that it was the Senate's responsibility for now. Mr. Schiff agreed, saying that there was \"little sense\" in bringing Mr. Bolton into the House now.PhotographPresident Trump, with Vice President Mike Pence, on Sunday issued contradicting tweets about impeachment charges against him.

Biden Jr.'s son has coincided with the former vice president's overwhelming electoral turnaround.WASHINGTON -- Republicans are wielding the power of their Senate majority to intensify an election-year investigation of Hunter Biden's work for a Ukrainian energy firm, putting new scrutiny on the son of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the former vice president re-emerges as President Trump's chief rival for the presidency.In elevating questions about the younger Mr. Biden's work in Ukraine, Senate Republicans are effectively picking up where the president left off last year when he pressed the country's leaders to investigate the Bidens, an effort that led to his impeachment in the House on charges that he abused his power by seeking foreign help in the 2020 election. It is part of a broader attempt by his allies on Capitol Hill to breathe fresh life into politically charged inquiries into issues that have preoccupied Mr. Trump.Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, plans to hold a vote next week despite Democratic objections to issue a rare Senate subpoena to Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian official who worked for Burisma, the energy firm. Mr. Johnson told reporters on Wednesday that he would release an interim report this spring summarizing what Republicans had learned from months of quiet queries.For now, Republicans insist Burisma is a matter of longstanding interest unrelated to Mr. Biden's presidential candidacy, and no evidence has emerged to suggest that either Biden acted improperly. But Mr. Johnson acknowledged that his investigation could affect the election and said that was as it should be.\"These are questions that Joe Biden has never adequately answered,\" Mr. Johnson told reporters in the Capitol, a day after Mr. Biden's remarkable Super Tuesday turnabout. \"And if I were a Democrat primary voter, I'd want these questions satisfactorily answered before I cast my final vote.\"The increased interest in the Bidens comes as Senate Republicans have ramped up other investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically, including an inquiry into the F.B.I.'s Russia investigation and claims that Democrats colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 election.Mr. Biden's campaign has branded the Johnson investigation an abuse of congressional authority and maintained that it would find no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president or his family. But Democrats are concerned that Republicans are trying to recreate their playbook for the run-up to the 2016 election, when Mr. Trump -- aided by Republicans and Fox News -- worked to weaponize a steady stream of small disclosures from an investigation into Hillary Clinton to cast her as secretive and potentially corrupt.Some Republicans have privately voiced discomfort about the effort. On Thursday, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah and a member of the Homeland Security Committee, told reporters that there was \"no question\" that \"looking into Burisma and Hunter appears political.\" He said he was not yet sure if he would support the subpoena.Mr. Romney was the only member of his party who voted at the Senate impeachment trial to convict Mr. Trump of abuse of power and remove him from office.\"People are tired of these kind of political investigations, and would hope that if there is something of significance that needs to be evaluated, it would be done by perhaps the F.B.I. and some other agency that is not as political as a committee of our body,\" he said.But Mr. Trump has embraced the effort, using his megaphone to try to create a shroud of innuendo and doubt about an increasingly viable opponent. On Wednesday, he circulated on Twitter a report about Mr. Johnson's investigation and later told Sean Hannity of Fox News that portraying the Bidens as corrupt would be a central theme of his bid for re-election.\"That will be a major issue in the campaign,\" Mr. Trump said in the interview. \"I will bring that up all the time.\"At issue is Hunter Biden's position on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian oil and gas company with a history of corruption, which he held while his father served as vice president overseeing United States policy toward the former Soviet republic. The younger Mr. Biden had no expertise on energy issues and was paid a large salary. Mr. Trump and Republicans have continually raised questions about the arrangement, claiming with no evidence that it was part of a corrupt scheme.Mr. Johnson and Senate Republicans are specifically investigating whether Burisma used Hunter Biden's name and influence to gain access to the Obama administration.The investigation closely resembles the one that Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake last year into whether Mr. Biden sought to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor for investigating Burisma. That allegation has been discredited -- the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was widely viewed as corrupt, and his removal was supported by many American and European officials. (Mr. Johnson was among the Republican and Democratic senators who signed a letter at the time calling for \"urgent reforms\" to his office.)But Republicans mounting an impeachment defense for the president in the Senate later said Mr. Trump had been justified in wanting Ukraine to scrutinize the episode, insisting that the president had been asking for a legitimate investigation of possible corruption, not a political favor to smear a rival.Now, Republican senators argue that Mr. Biden's son is fair game.\"I am not saying Joe Biden is corrupt -- far from it,\" said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. \"But he had knowledge that his son was sitting on the most corrupt board in the Ukraine, when he was trying to clean up the Ukraine. We are going to hold him accountable for that.\"Democrats say Senate Republicans are knowingly raising a false flag for an operation designed to legitimize claims by Mr. Trump and some in the conservative news media.\"What is actually new here?\" said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, one of the Democrats trying to counter the inquiry. \"There is no evidence to date that has implicated Vice President Biden in wrongdoing of any kind, and we base that on our review of hundreds of documents.\"Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign, accused Mr. Johnson of \"abusing congressional authority in a manner that would make the founding fathers spin in their graves.\"\"We already knew that Donald Trump is terrified of facing Joe Biden -- because he got himself impeached by trying to force a foreign country to spread lies about the vice president on behalf of his re-election campaign,\" Mr. Bates said. \"Now, Senator Johnson just flat-out conceded that this is a ham-handed effort to manipulate Democratic primary voters.\"Those leading the inquiries insist their focus on Burisma is not politically driven, noting that it dates to 2017, before it was clear that Mr. Biden would be a presidential candidate.\"We are proceeding with the investigation whether Biden is in or out,\" said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Finance Committee, who co-signed numerous requests with Mr. Johnson. \"This investigation is about conflicts of interest, not political candidates.\"In addition to the Burisma matter, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Grassley are investigating whether Democrats conspired with Ukrainian officials to harm Mr. Trump's campaign in 2016. Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has previously warned his fellow chairmen in private that any investigation that turned on information from Ukraine should be handled delicately because it could advance Russian efforts to spread disinformation, according to two officials familiar with the discussions, which were first reported by Politico. (Mr. Burr said this week that he had no objection to Mr. Johnson's investigation.)It is unclear how far the Burisma investigation has advanced. The senators indicated they had received documents from multiple individuals in recent weeks, and the State Department has handed over 2,800 pages of records.Mr. Johnson sought approval for the subpoena from Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, the top Democrat in the Homeland Security Committee, but Mr. Peters refused, citing concerns similar to Mr. Burr's.In a letter to committee members on Sunday informing them of the subpoena vote next week, Mr. Johnson stressed that his staff was going to \"great lengths\" to consult with intelligence and law enforcement officials first.\"I share the ranking member's interest in ensuring that the Senate and this committee not be used to advance disinformation,\" he wrote in the letter, which came the day after Mr. Biden won the South Carolina primary.PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

Bolton, the former national security adviser, had confirmed a central allegation against Mr. Trump had roiled the Capitol and upended his push to block new witnesses, and if Mr. McConnell did not corral restive Republicans into submission, the trial could be blown wide open.\"We can be smart or we can be stupid,\" Mr. McConnell warned his rank and file during a closed-door lunch of halibut, fried chicken and pecan pie in the Capitol, steps from the Senate floor where the trial was to convene shortly. \"The choice will be up to us.\"Republicans ultimately opted, as they almost invariably do, to stick with Mr. McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and block Democrats' attempts to allow new evidence to be considered. All but one of them voted on Wednesday to acquit Mr. Trump of both of the charges against him.The story of how Mr. McConnell held Republicans together -- even in the face of stunning revelations about the president's conduct and uneasiness in his party about Mr. Trump's actions -- reflects how a master Senate tactician deployed his command of procedure and keen political instincts to lock down a process that posed an existential threat to the president. In doing so, he may have cemented the president's hold on his office and provided a defiant campaign message to propel him to re-election, uniting the party around a figure who brooks no dissent and dealing a death blow to Democrats' hopes of removing him.\"If this was all about politics, and it was, at least at the moment I think it is fair to conclude that we won and they lost,\" Mr. McConnell said in an interview on Thursday in his Capitol office, before he headed to the White House, where he was effusively thanked by the president and received a standing ovation in the East Room.A Year of PreparationDemocrats contend that the victory is hollow, and that they won something as well, showing the public that Senate Republicans -- including several who are facing re-election this year in politically competitive states -- were unwilling to challenge Mr. Trump on either his behavior or his blithe dismissal of Congress's right to oversee the executive branch.\"What we feel is we created Pyrrhic victory for them,\" Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said in an interview. \"This trial is regarded by most Americans as not a real trial, a sham. The acquittal has virtually no value because American know it wasn't fair.\"But it evidently has great value to the president and to Mr. McConnell, who had spent nearly a year preparing for it. From the instant that Democrats assumed power in the House last January, denying that they had any intention of impeaching Mr. Trump, Mr. McConnell, a six-term Kentuckian and the longest-serving Senate Republican leader, directed his staff to quietly dig into the history of impeachments and consult with outside experts.\"We thought they would finally work themselves up to doing this on something,\" Mr. McConnell said. \"It has been threatened endlessly. We needed to come up to speed on what actually happens, and that began in earnest last fall.\"So when Mr. McConnell fielded a phone call from Mr. Trump days before Christmas, he was ready. Stung by the House vote to impeach him on two charges, the president reached out to the majority leader from his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Palm Beach, Fla., throwing out ideas about how to handle his coming Senate trial.Mr. McConnell had a reassuring response for the third president ever to face removal by the Senate, urging Mr. Trump to trust him to manage the confrontation.\"What I have consistently said to him is I think I know more about the Senate than you do, which he usually concedes,\" Mr. McConnell recalled, saying he told the president to keep public commentary about impeachment to a minimum. \"My consistent advice to him with regard to this subject was to avoid it -- and for the most part, for the most part, he did.\"Throughout the process, Mr. McConnell consistently refused to say how he viewed the president's conduct, even as other Republicans eventually said that Mr. Trump's actions were wrong, inappropriate and even shameful.\"I say things I choose to say,\" he said when pressed Thursday.Yet that reticence did not dampen Mr. McConnell's zeal for beating back the impeachment push. Interviews with more than two dozen senators and top aides reflected how the impeachment fight that came to a close on Wednesday was never about whether Mr. Trump would be the first president to be removed from office -- both sides knew he would not. It was instead about how Republicans and Democrats would arrive at the inevitable outcome, and how much damage they would inflict on one another, the president and the Senate in the process.Mr. McConnell set out to create the framework for a trial that his members could get behind, that could withstand the possibility of compromising new information emerging and that would deliver the White House a quick but credible verdict of \"not guilty.\" It went far from perfectly for Republicans -- among other setbacks, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, voted \"guilty\" on the charge of abuse of power, depriving Mr. Trump of the absolute party loyalty he coveted -- but Mr. McConnell reached his desired end.\"He is very good at what he does,\" said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and a close ally of Mr. McConnell.By October, Mr. McConnell recognized that a trial was a near certainty. An anonymous White House whistle-blower had accused Mr. Trump of trying to cheat in the 2020 election by seeking to condition crucial military aid to Ukraine on the country announcing investigations into his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden. The Democratic-led House was plunging ahead over solid Republican opposition.Mr. McConnell tasked Andrew Ferguson, his chief counsel, with mapping out a full trial strategy. He spoke with Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, counseling him that the White House needed to take the impeachment process seriously and study how President Bill Clinton's White House built a legal and communications defense team in 1998.Then he began to educate his colleagues, delivering a PowerPoint presentation to his members on what an impeachment trial would look like, introducing senators with a self-conscious matter-of-factness to what he called the \"Clinton model.\" He and his advisers quickly determined that the question of calling witnesses would be the focal point of the trial fight and they seized on the ground rules governing Mr. Clinton's 1999 trial. In that proceeding, the modern precedent, the debate over witnesses came only after the House and the White House made opening arguments and senators posed written questions.That approach would help address a problem Mr. McConnell saw coming: likely demands by Democrats to include new testimony in the trial. In November, Mr. McConnell began sharing with Republicans his fear that votes to allow witnesses could create messy interparty disputes with the White House that would prolong the trial for weeks or more, without changing the outcome.He warned his fellow Republicans that Democrats would use the trial to force senators in tough re-election fights to take difficult votes as part of their drive to recapture the Senate.And Senate Democrats, led by Mr. Schumer were plotting just such a strategy. With no hope of reaching a two-thirds threshold for removing a president from office, they had no illusions about ousting Mr. Trump.The 'Legal Eagles'But Democrats wanted to make Republicans -- especially those facing voters in November -- cringe in defending the conduct of the president and force them to go on the record absolving Mr. Trump despite compelling evidence from the House that he had abused his power and sought to hide his actions from Congress.As the Thanksgiving recess approached, Mr. McConnell deputized a group of the senators who were lawyers to help him sell the plan. The \"Legal Eagles,\" as the group was informally called, included Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas, and John Cornyn of Texas and their role was to educate their colleagues in constitutional law. Mr. Cruz eventually set up a war room for the trial in a rented space off Capitol Hill, staffed by members of his congressional office and political organization.Mr. Schumer had his gaze down the road as well. In November and again in December, Mr. Schumer summoned to his office a dozen moderate Democrats known to have relationships with Republicans to make a request: They should feel out their Republican counterparts in the chamber on the Ukraine matter and the looming trial, and report back. The overtures went nowhere. There would not be another of the famous bipartisan Senate \"gangs\" to try to find a compromise outcome.One more twist would come before lawmakers departed for Christmas. After the House impeachment vote, Ms. Pelosi announced that she would delay sending the articles needed to formally spur the Senate trial until she was assured that Mr. McConnell would conduct a fair one. Democrats now say they were also worried that Mr. McConnell might use the holiday recess crunch to seek a quick dismissal of the accusations.He was not planning to do so, but also did not intend to relinquish his grip on the proceedings or bend to Ms. Pelosi. When he spoke with Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, on a call to celebrate the passage of a bipartisan omnibus spending bill, he offered a quiet warning.\"I've been in politics long enough to know you should never say never, but let me say this,\" Mr. McConnell told Mr. Hoyer. \"I will never allow the House of Representatives to dictate rules to the Senate. Never.\"Behind the scenes, Mr. McConnell was trying to nail down the backing of the handful of Republicans who could complicate his careful planning. Four senators had expressed enough qualms about the president to give them leverage to win concessions from Mr. McConnell: Mr. Romney of Utah, the 2012 presidential nominee; Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who had in the past bucked Mr. McConnell and the White House; Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a veteran politician with plans to retire, and Susan Collins of Maine, a centrist facing the re-election challenge of her career.In two early January meetings in Mr. McConnell's office, with Mr. Alexander participating by conference call, the four negotiated a guarantee that the Senate would vote on whether to allow witnesses as it had been done in the Clinton trial.When Mr. McConnell unveiled his proposed resolution on the eve of the trial, it immediately provoked an uproar. The language guaranteeing a vote on witnesses was there, but so was a provision limiting to two days the 24 hours the House prosecutors and the president's defense team had for their oral arguments. And the rules said the record of the House impeachment inquiry would not be admitted unless the Senate voted to do so later.In a private lunch before the trial was to open, Senate Republicans rebelled, saying that the two-day limit was too abbreviated and that the House record had to be admitted to provide the basic evidence in the proceeding. Mr. McConnell and his team quickly backtracked, scrawling last-minute changes in the margins of the resolution moments before the debate began. Senate Republicans adopted it on a party-line vote, after rejecting Democratic attempts to subpoena Mr. Bolton and other witnesses, beginning the trial on a contentious and partisan note.From the outset, the pace was grinding, with senators unaccustomed to the long hours confined to the chamber. The grueling schedule was no accident. Mr. McConnell had instructed his staff to make it punishing, to exhaust senators and fuel their eagerness to bring it to a quick end.But as the trial progressed, it remained uncertain whether enough Republicans would break with the party to force the Senate to call witnesses. Mr. McConnell and his lieutenants were increasingly confident that the prosecution's arguments -- often repetitive -- were not taking hold and that Republicans were eager to move on.Then on Jan. 26, The New York Times reported that Mr. Bolton's firsthand account directly undercut the president's defense, rattling Republicans and complicating Mr. McConnell's plans.At the luncheon, Mr. McConnell led his anxious colleagues through a litany of sharp questions about what could go wrong if Republicans buckled and called Mr. Bolton. He kept up the pressure after the trial adjourned later that afternoon, gathering Republicans again, this time in a smaller room with just one door to limit comings and goings. Brandishing a card bearing a whip count, he made it clear that Republicans still lacked the votes to defeat witnesses, an unmistakable message that it was time for them to fall into line.\"I thought they needed to hear it,\" he said in the interview. \"There were no free passes.\"As he worked to round up votes to block witnesses, Mr. McConnell told wavering Republicans that they were being used as pawns in a Democratic scheme to undermine the courts by embarrassing Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who was presiding over the trial.Managing 'Quid Pro Quo'When Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat running for president, asked whether a chief justice overseeing a trial without witnesses would undermine the courts, Mr. McConnell scrawled a quick note to Ms. Murkowski, who was still undecided on witnesses, to point out the attack.With his eye on the undecided senators, Mr. Cruz also counseled the White House legal team to avoid arguing that there was no quid pro quo -- \"a strategic mistake\" that might make Mr. Bolton's testimony seem more relevant to those lawmakers. During questioning, Mr. Cruz helped draft a question, submitted jointly with senators like Ms. Murkowski and Mr. Alexander, that asked Mr. Trump's legal team whether, if Mr. Bolton testified to the existence of a quid pro quo, it would amount to an impeachable offense.When Patrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel, rose to answer, asserting that Mr. Trump had never engaged in a quid pro quo, Mr. Cruz was \"a little white-knuckled,\" he recalled. But then the answer he was looking for came: Even if there was a quid pro quo, it did not matter.\"I think that answer played a really important part in helping get the votes of both Lamar and Lisa,\" Mr. Cruz said later.By the next day, Ms. Murkowski had come out against witnesses, using as a rationale what she characterized as an attack on Chief Justice Roberts. She followed Mr. Alexander, who said that while Mr. Trump had acted inappropriately, his actions did not merit impeachment. The final vote on witnesses was 51 to 49 and the trial hurtled to its finale, with Mr. Romney's vote to convict the president as the final twist.Mr. McConnell shrugged off fierce criticism that he had overseen a sham.\"I didn't rig anything,\" he said. \"We had a vote. No vote was prevented. No debate was prevented. These guys didn't have the votes,\" he said of Senate Democrats.\"These guys would win more often if they win more elections,\" he said, \"and they have the opportunity to do that this year.\"PhotographFrom top, Senator Mitch McConnell directed his staff to prepare for impeachment the instant Democrats assumed power in the House. \"We needed to come up to speed on what actually happens,\" he said. In the end, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, saw a hollow victory for Republicans. Along the way, Speaker Nancy Pelosi introduced a twist, delaying the sending of the articles to the Senate as she pressed for assurance a trial would be fair. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY T.J.

Putin of Russia favored President Trump's re-election. The briefing later prompted Mr. Trump's anger as he complained that Democrats would use it against him.Joseph Maguire, the former acting director of national intelligence, and his deputy, Andrew P. Hallman, resigned on Friday. Mr. Grenell told Mr. Hallman, popular in the office's Liberty Crossing headquarters, that his service was no longer needed, according to two officials. Mr. Hallman, who has worked in the office or at the C.I.A. for three decades, expressed confidence in his colleagues in a statement but also referred to the \"uncertainties that come with change.\"The ouster of Mr. Hallman and exit of Mr. Maguire, who also oversaw the National Counterterrorism Center, allowed Mr. Grenell to install his own leadership team.One of his first hires was Kashyap Patel, a senior National Security Council staff member and former key aide to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Patel will have a mandate to \"clean house,\" CBS News reported, citing a person close to the matter.Mr. Patel was best known as the lead author of a politically charged memo two years ago that accused F.B.I. and Justice Department leaders of abusing their surveillance powers to spy on a former Trump campaign adviser. The memo was widely criticized as misleading, though an inspector general later found other problems with aspects of the surveillance.Working with Mr. Nunes, Mr. Patel began what they called Objective Medusa to examine the F.B.I.'s investigation into whether anyone associated with the Trump campaign conspired with Russia's election interference in 2016.\"I hired him to bust doors down,\" Mr. Nunes told the author Lee Smith for his book \"The Plot Against the President,\" which chronicles Mr. Patel's investigations on behalf of the Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee. Mr. Patel was interviewed extensively in the book, which claims without proof that journalists, diplomats, law enforcement and intelligence officials engaged in a vast plot to undermine Mr. Trump's campaign and then bring him down as president.As acting director of national intelligence, Mr. Grenell has access to any secrets he may want to review. And he has requested access to information from the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, according to two people familiar with the matter.The revelations about last week's briefing reignited fears about Russia's continuing efforts to interfere in the American election, including in the Democratic primary races.During the briefing, which was supposed to focus on coordination between government agencies to fight election interference, not the acts themselves, Republicans challenged the intelligence agencies' conclusion that the Russians continue to favor Mr. Trump. Some officials said the briefing was not meant to be controversial and that intelligence officials intended to simply reiterate what they had told the Senate Intelligence Committee weeks earlier.Intelligence officials have already documented instances of the Kremlin trying to influence American politics, namely attempts by Russian military intelligence officers to hack into the Ukrainian energy company that once employed the son of former Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. Officials want to know whether the breach was an effort to help Mr. Trump, whose efforts to persuade Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Biden helped prompt his impeachment.And during the congressional impeachment hearings, Fiona Hill, a former senior White House official who worked on Russia issues, warned about Moscow's continued efforts to spread disinformation.Mr. Trump himself wrote in a January letter accompanying the administration's national counterintelligence strategy that \"Russia remains a significant intelligence threat to United States interests -- employing aggressive acts to instigate and exacerbate tensions and instability in the United States, including interfering with the security of our elections.\"Intelligence officials were scheduled to brief the full House and Senate on election security on March 10, arrangements that were made weeks ago, accounting to congressional aides.How long Mr. Grenell will be able to stay as the acting director is an open question. For him to remain past March 11 -- a limit imposed by federal law -- Mr. Trump must formally nominate someone else for the director of national intelligence post.Mr. Trump told reporters late Thursday that he was considering Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the intelligence committee, but Mr. Collins took himself out of the running the next morning.Mr. Collins, who helped lead the president's impeachment defense, had received no advance notice that he was under consideration for the top intelligence post. He saw no reason to entertain a job he did not want, especially as he wages a special election battle for a Senate seat in his home state of Georgia.\"I know the problems in our intelligence community, but this is not a job that interests me at this time,\" Mr. Collins said on Fox Business. \"It's not one that I would accept because I'm running a Senate race.\"People close to Mr. Collins have speculated that the president might have been trying to entice Mr. Collins out of that election to tamp down a messy intraparty fight that could cost Republicans control of the seat. Party leaders have converged around Senator Kelly Loeffler since Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia appointed her to fill the state's vacant Senate seat late last year and have made no secret of their disdain for Mr. Collins's refusal to exit the race.A nomination to a cabinet-level position would have required Mr. Collins to drop out of the race. But given his lack of intelligence experience and political track record, there was little likelihood the Senate would have confirmed him to the post.With Mr. Collins off the table, Mr. Trump will need another potential nominee. The White House is considering Pete Hoekstra, the former Republican congressman who is now the American ambassador to the Netherlands, according to three officials.Whether the Senate would be willing to formally consider Mr. Hoekstra is unclear. But if Mr. Trump were to send a nomination to the Senate it would, under federal law, allow Mr. Grenell to serve for at least another six months.In a statement praising Mr. Maguire and Mr. Hallman, Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, made no reference to Mr. Grenell.On Friday, questions arose about Mr. Grenell's past employment after ProPublica reported that he had done work for a Moldovan oligarch named Vladimir Plahotniuc who was banned from entering the United States because of his involvement in significant corruption.Mr. Grenell wrote articles defending Mr. Plahotniuc but did not disclose he had been paid for his work, ProPublica reported. A lawyer speaking on Mr. Grenell's behalf said he was not required to register with the Justice Department because he was not working at the direction of a foreign power.David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.David E.

Schiff took a risk in telling senators they must convict and remove President Trump because \"you know you can't trust this president to do what's right for this country.\"WASHINGTON -- Senator James M. Inhofe, a conservative Republican from Oklahoma, has made clear that he intends to vote to acquit President Trump. But after Representative Adam B. Schiff's fiery speech Thursday night calling for the president's removal, Mr. Inhofe felt compelled to give his fellow lawmaker some grudging respect.\"I have to say this,\" Mr. Inhofe told reporters Friday morning in the Capitol. \"Schiff is very, very effective.\"Mr. Schiff, a California Democrat who steered the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump and is the lead prosecutor in his Senate trial, has long been a hero to the left and a villain to the right. But never has he aroused as much passion as he has during his closing arguments in the president's impeachment trial.First, there was Thursday's declaration that \"you know you can't trust this president to do what's right for this country,\" and then on Friday, he invoked a news report that Republican senators had been warned that their heads would be \"on a pike\" if they voted against Mr. Trump.On Friday morning, the phrase #RightMatters -- from the last line of Mr. Schiff's Thursday speech -- was trending as a hashtag on Twitter. The Daily Beast declared that the remarks \"will go down in history.\" Ryan Knight, a progressive activist, called it \"a closing statement for the ages.\" Video of the speech quickly went viral. Liberals lavished him with praise.\"I am in tears,\" wrote Debra Messing, the \"Will & Grace\" actress and outspoken Trump critic. \"Thank you Chairman Schiff for fighting for our country.\"Republicans had precisely the opposite reaction. Many view Mr. Schiff, 59, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, as a slick and self-righteous political operator intent on undoing the results of the 2016 election -- or preventing Mr. Trump from winning in 2020. In the Senate, Republicans took particular umbrage at his declaration that they could not trust the president.\"I don't trust Adam Schiff,\" Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, shot back.On Fox News, Mr. Schiff was filleted. \"Amateur Thespian Schiff Tries Out Some New Lines,\" TV monitors broadcasting the network declared Thursday, as the host Tucker Carlson mocked the congressman, calling him a \"wild-eyed conspiracy nut.\"And if Mr. Schiff had made any inroads with Republicans in the Senate chamber, he may have undercut them on Friday with his \"head on a pike\" remark, drawn from an anonymously sourced CBS News report. Mr. Schiff used it to liken Mr. Trump to a monarch, but the implication was that Republicans were terrified of crossing him.\"The whole room was visibly upset on our side,\" said Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, \"and it's sad, it's insulting and demeaning to everyone to say that we somehow live in fear and that the president has threatened all of us to put our head on the pike.\"A Stanford- and Harvard-educated lawyer, Mr. Schiff is drawing on skills he honed as a young federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. He first drew national attention in 1990 by winning the conviction of an F.B.I. agent who became romantically entangled with a Russian spy, and was accused of selling government secrets in exchange for promises of gold and cash.Prosecutors said Mr. Schiff took a risk in his bald declaration Thursday night that the president could not be trusted because Republicans in the chamber, almost all of whom support Mr. Trump, would see the criticism as implicitly directed at them.\"When you make an argument like that, you better be sure that your entire audience is with you,\" said James G. McGovern, a criminal defense lawyer at Hogan Lovells in New York and a former prosecutor.Multiple Republicans said afterward that they had not at all been moved by Mr. Schiff. \"It seems to me their case is weaker today than it was yesterday,\" said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican.But Anne Milgram, a former attorney general of New Jersey and now a law professor at New York University, described Mr. Schiff's sharp criticism of Mr. Trump as a \"wise calculation,\" because unlike a regular jury trial, Mr. Schiff does not need a unanimous verdict. The argument was aimed, she said, at the four or so moderate Republicans whose votes Democrats will need to call witnesses at the trial.Regardless of the risk, it was clear on both sides of the aisle -- and to experienced prosecutors who watched -- that after a long day of complicated and sometimes monotonous testimony, Mr. Schiff's oratory broke through. Mr. Schiff apparently thought so himself. He posted the last eight minutes, the most dramatic part of his speech, on Twitter Thursday night, and by Friday evening it had been viewed 5.9 million times.\"Sometimes when Schiff steps to the mic I think he's a little scripted,\" Ms. Milgram said. \"I did not feel that last night. I thought it was the most authentic I have seen him. He sort of crossed into another level.\"Mr. Schiff opened by carefully leading the Senate through the House's case that the president abused his office by trying to enlist Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, weaving in bits and pieces of testimony and commentary along the way. He then turned to his Senate audience and stated what he believes to be the obvious: Mr. Trump is guilty.\"Do we really have any doubt about the facts here?\" Mr. Schiff asked. \"Does anybody really question whether the president is capable of what he's charged with? No one is really making the argument Donald Trump would never do such a thing, because of course we know that he would, and of course we know that he did.\"But that, Mr. Schiff said, led to the most critical question of all: \"Does he really need to be removed?\" The answer was yes, Mr. Schiff said, then offered a situation in which the Russians interfered in the 2020 election to help Mr. Trump, just as they did in 2016.\"Can you have the least bit of confidence that Donald Trump will stand up to them and protect our national interest over his own personal interest?\" Mr. Schiff said. \"You know you can't, which makes him dangerous to this country.\"In the Capitol, Mr. Schiff is ordinarily serious, composed and in control. But as he moved toward his closing comments, he grew visibly emotional as he recalled the testimony of Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the White House national security aide and Ukrainian immigrant who testified in impeachment hearings before Congress and helped Democrats build their case.Colonel Vindman, who fled the former Soviet Union with his family when he was 3, testified that he felt deeply uncomfortable with a telephone call Mr. Trump had on July 25 with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, when Mr. Trump asked the Ukrainian leader to \"do us a favor\" and investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Mr. Schiff recalled how Colonel Vindman told lawmakers that unlike in the former Soviet Union, \"right matters\" in the United States.\"Well, let me tell you something,\" Mr. Schiff went on, his forefinger jabbing the air for emphasis. \"If right doesn't matter, if right doesn't matter, it doesn't matter how good the Constitution is. It doesn't matter how brilliant the framers were. Doesn't matter how good or bad our advocacy in this trial is.\" If \"right doesn't matter,\" he concluded, \"we're lost.\"Michael D. Shear and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.Trump on Trial is a continuing series of articles offering reporting, analysis and impressions of the Senate impeachment proceedings.Word count: 1268Show lessYou have requested \"on-the-fly\" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

So is a Tea Party hero.DES MOINES -- The line outside the Trump rally on Thursday night was perhaps not the safest space to try to conduct a Socratic dialogue about the nature of truth. But Joe Walsh -- former Tea Party congressman, former right-wing radio host, current Trump opponent -- leaned right in.\"I'm a Republican and a conservative and I'm challenging Trump in the primary,\" he announced to a Trump supporter festooned in campaign-themed clothing. \"Let me ask you this: Has Donald Trump ever lied to the American people?\"A nanosecond passed, while the supporter bristled at this unfamiliar scenario. \"Nothing comes to mind,\" he said.Mr. Walsh mentioned that President Trump, despite promising fiscal responsibility, had presided over an increase in the federal deficit greater than that under President Barack Obama.\"I couldn't speak to that,\" said the supporter, who did not want to give his name, on account of not trusting reporters. \"Sometimes we say things and they might not be full of truth, but we all make mistakes. He's a straight guy. I love his tenacity.\"Another supporter had been growing noticeably agitated as he heard this exchange. (He also did not want to give his name.) \"Let me ask you something!\" he said. \"Has Adam Schiff ever lied?\" he asked, referring to Representative Adam B. Schiff, a lead impeachment manager. \"What about 'Shifty Schiff'? You're like Adam Schiff\" -- he pointed at Mr. Walsh -- \"lying to the American people!\"If it is hard to be a Democratic candidate in the crowded and uncertain 2020 field, it may be even harder to be a Republican trying to present a legitimate alternative to a president whose supporters won't entertain the idea of anyone else, and who is all but certain to be the party's nominee.Mr. Trump won Iowa with 51 percent of the vote in 2016 and still has high approval ratings from the state's Republicans. But if local party members were feeling rather left out this past week with so much focus on the Democrats -- all those candidates, all those events -- the president had swooped in to remind them that there was a new election coming up and that, as he said on Twitter, he was \"America's Greatest President.\" And Mr. Walsh was there to present a countermessage: No, he wasn't.There used to be three Republican challengers -- Mr. Walsh, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts and former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina -- but Mr. Sanford dropped out just two months after entering the race, and now there are two.The odds are never great for same-party challengers when an incumbent president runs for re-election. But the candidates say that as Mr. Trump has consolidated his hold over the Republican Party, things have gotten increasingly difficult. For one thing, the party has, in 37 states and territories, changed the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, a move likely to limit dissenting voices on the convention floor.Also, many state Republican committees have canceled this year's primaries altogether; others have put up prohibitively difficult barriers for challengers to enter or said they would hold primaries with just a single name -- Donald J. Trump -- on the ballot.\"They're behind Trump lock and key,\" Mr. Walsh said. When he showed up at the Republican National Committee in Washington last month to lodge a complaint about what he said was \"the disenfranchisement of millions of Republican voters,\" the guards wouldn't let him past the lobby.Mr. Weld gamely made his own voice-in-the-wilderness case to several dozen people at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, on Saturday. He was joined by Jim Leach, a longtime member of Congress from Iowa and former chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, whose public endorsement of Mr. Weld seems like a daring move in the current climate. (\"The only reason I can is that I am not an elected official,\" Mr. Leach said by telephone.)In a phone interview, Mr. Weld said he felt like \"a two-headed cow at the Iowa State Fair,\" a figure of curiosity on account of his uphill campaign. He said that many Republicans shared his view of the president but were afraid to say so.\"The party may be redeemable, but the president is not redeemable,\" he said. \"He's gone too far in the direction of wanting to undermine democratic institutions to amass power for himself. \"He and Mr. Walsh have also been making their case to voters in one-on-one conversations in bars and coffee shops in Des Moines in the lead-up to Monday's caucuses. James Marren, who showed up at the Exile bar to talk to Mr. Walsh the other night, said that he had encountered the candidate before, at a veterans' group in Dubuque, and that he was a changed man from his days as a right-wing, pro-Trump radio host spouting incendiary conspiracy theories.\"It was all Democrats and him,\" said Mr. Marren, 75, a Democrat so impressed by Mr. Walsh that he is talking him up to his Republican friends. \"He said that Trump's a liar and a traitor. He apologized for what he used to say on his radio show. He was amazing.\"But at the Trump rally, it was a different story. Virtually everyone Mr. Walsh spoke to disagreed with virtually everything he said.When he mentioned Ukraine, a Trump supporter said that \"Obama got that started.\" When Mr. Walsh pointed out that Mr. Trump had vowed to make Mexico pay for the border wall, but was instead using money from the United States military budget, another supporter first said that Mexico was indeed paying for it, in that there are fewer Mexicans crossing the border and thus fewer Mexicans sending \"American money\" back home. Then she said: \"Well, he would have made the Mexican government pay for it, but a lot of people are standing in his way.\"After just a few minutes of these encounters, Mr. Walsh was beginning to seem like the most masochistic person in Iowa.\"These are the people who listened to me on the radio\" when he was a darling of the right, he said. \"I can relate to why they voted for Trump. I voted for him in 2016. But then I saw that he lies damn near every time he opens his mouth.\"The turning point for him was Mr. Trump's 2018 meeting in Helsinki with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, in which Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Putin's claim -- contrary to American intelligence -- that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 election. \"That was the most unpatriotic thing I've ever seen an American president do,\" Mr. Walsh said.Suddenly, in line, Mr. Walsh ran into an old neighbor from Chicago, Mark Weyermuller, who had supported him in his congressional days but had traveled to Des Moines on this occasion for the president.It was an awkward encounter. \"You know they've canceled the Republican primaries in 10 states,\" Mr. Walsh said.Mr. Weyermuller said that he had not heard that before but that it was \"sort of a goofy system.\"\"I'm happy for you, but I'm supporting Donald J. Trump,\" he said, and he moved on.Then there was Matt Locke, a.k.a. the Conservative Sharpshooter, a talk-radio and podcast host who had traveled from Texas to spend an evening listening to Mr. Trump.\"You're a Tea Party guy, Joe,\" Mr. Locke said. \"What happened?\"The two talked at loud cross-purposes about topics like corruption among Ukrainian prosecutors; Democrats who have foreign investments; and, once again, whether Mr. Trump has ever lied. (\"I don't know,\" Mr. Locke said sarcastically. \"Has he?\") The discussion turned to the time Mr. Trump publicly invited China to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family.\"He wasn't serious!\" Mr. Locke said. \"He was joking. You gotta have a sense of humor.\"The two agreed to vehemently disagree, and Mr. Walsh went off into the cold to find some other voters who also disagreed with him.\"I don't mind Joe,\" said Mr. Locke, \"but he doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell.\"PhotographJoe Walsh, a former Republican congressman, tried to find an audience outside President Trump's rally in Des Moines on Thursday.

In his own address, Mr. Sanders said the coronavirus crisis was \"on the scale of major war.\"WILMINGTON, Del. -- Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday delivered a forceful rebuke of President Trump's leadership amid the coronavirus crisis, seeking to project steadiness and resolve from his perch as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.In his own speech about the pandemic, Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden's main rival, also flamed the president's response. He provided a long list of policy proposals aimed in particular at helping low-income and working-class families, providing a glimpse of the extraordinary measures he might take if he were president.\"The crisis we face from the coronavirus is on a scale of a major war,\" he said at a news conference in Burlington, Vt. \"And we must act accordingly.\"Taken together, the candidates' blistering denunciations of the president's handling of the outbreak signaled that the coronavirus has fully overtaken the 2020 race, forcing the candidates to cancel events and propose new ways of campaigning, putting fresh political pressure on Mr. Trump, and placing matters of public health and trust at the forefront of the contest.Mr. Biden, the former vice president, spoke Thursday afternoon from the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington, Del., about the grave challenges the country faces, and he detailed his ideas for managing the outbreak. He also aimed to draw sharp contrasts with Mr. Trump a day after the president addressed the nation from the Oval Office, establishing a preview of what Mr. Biden hopes will be a general election matchup.\"Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,\" Mr. Biden said, speaking from the hotel where he announced his 1972 bid for the Senate. \"Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president fueled by adversarial relationship with the truth that he continues to have.\"This moment of national anxiety, some of Mr. Biden's allies believe, throws into sharp relief the choice Americans would face in a general-election matchup between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, and the stakes of that contest. Mr. Biden has been seeking to frame the race as a two-person contest against the president, in ways overt and subtle, even as he continues a primary battle with Mr. Sanders.In his remarks, Mr. Biden offered his own plan for combating the virus, with proposals that included rapidly and vastly expanding testing -- tests, he said, should be available at no charge -- moving aggressively to boost hospital capacity and supporting an accelerated push for a vaccine that he said should be \"again, free of charge.\" And he argued that \"the administration's failure on testing is colossal.\"\"We are not ready yet, and the clock is ticking,\" he warned.He also described plans to help those who are struggling financially at a time of economic peril, appeared dismissive of corporate tax subsidies and said it was a \"national disgrace that millions of our fellow citizens don't have a single day of paid sick leave.\"Mr. Sanders, for his part, urged the president to declare the pandemic a national emergency, and encouraged the public and private sectors to work together to combat the virus and its effects. Like Mr. Biden, he outlined a list of recommendations to deal with the pandemic, including establishing national and state information hotlines, making all treatment \"free of charge,\" providing \"emergency unemployment assistance\" to those who lose their jobs, and expanding the Meals on Wheels and school lunch programs and SNAP \"so that no one goes hungry during this crisis.\" He also urged a \"moratorium on evictions, on foreclosures and on utility shut offs.\"Perhaps above all, he used the health crisis as another opportunity to call for his signature health care plan, \"Medicare for all.\"\"Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,\" he said.His remarks amounted to a vigorous critique of Mr. Trump, cloaked in the kind of sweeping, uncompromising proposals that have long defined his democratic socialist agenda. He left the news conference without taking questions.Mr. Biden's appearance here in Delaware came as his campaign underwent another shake-up after an initial shuffling last month. He brought on a new campaign manager as his team works to build out what has been an underfunded operation with major organizational challenges -- despite a flurry of primary victories over the past two weeks.Amid those successes, Mr. Biden has further intensified his focus on Mr. Trump, acting as if the general election were already underway. On Wednesday, his team announced the formation of a \"Public Health Advisory Committee\" studded with prominent health leaders and alumni of former President Barack Obama's administration -- a rollout that seemed intended to conjure the actions a president might take.Members included Vivek Murthy, a former surgeon general; Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a prominent oncologist and a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania; and Lisa Monaco, who served as a homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to Mr. Obama. And when he spoke on Thursday, he did so against a backdrop of American flags, reading from teleprompters to the click of cameras and beginning with a nod to his \"fellow Americans,\" a setting reminiscent of a White House address.\"No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks,\" he said. \"But I can promise you this. When I'm president, we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better. We'll lead with science. We'll listen to the experts. We'll heed their advice. And we'll build American leadership and rebuild it to rally the world to meet the global threats.\"Throughout his remarks, Mr. Biden nodded -- as he often does -- to what he cast as the resiliency and potential of the American people.Mr. Biden, who is 77, did not stop to take shouted questions about his own health.He has previously expressed shock and frustration at Mr. Trump's past skeptical remarks about the severity of the virus, and has sketched out other steps he would take as president to fight it, noting his work as vice president in combating Ebola. Ron Klain, who was Mr. Obama's Ebola \"czar,\" is a top Biden adviser.Mr. Trump's own somber address Wednesday night, in which he announced he was blocking most travel from continental Europe and promised new aid for workers and businesses, was a break from his previous efforts to play down the effects of the outbreak. But he also mischaracterized some of his administration's new travel policies and described the threat as a \"foreign virus,\" though Americans are infected along with many in other countries.The Trump campaign quickly issued a response to Mr. Biden's remarks on Thursday. \"In times like this, America needs leadership and Biden has shown none,\" said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. \"President Trump acted early and decisively and has put the United States on stronger footing than other nations. His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears.\"As for Mr. Sanders, Mr. Murtaugh said in another statement, \"He's just another Democrat candidate for president trying to score political points by recklessly provoking anxiety and fear.\" He also argued that the proposal from Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator -- who supports a sweeping single-payer system -- would \"drive doctors and other medical workers away from the profession, leaving America woefully unprepared for public health emergencies.\"Even as the candidates sought to project images of leadership, they are still politicians who face another debate and another round of primary elections in the coming days, and they are scrambling to adjust to a presidential contest now unfolding amid a pandemic.In one sign of the major changes the virus is forcing on the presidential race, Mr. Biden's team on Wednesday announced that previously scheduled campaign events in Chicago and Miami would be transformed into \"virtual events\" ahead of next Tuesday's primaries in Illinois, Florida and several other large, delegate-rich states. And Mr. Biden -- whose famously tactile campaigning style is off-putting to some and delights others -- acknowledged the need for \"radical changes in our personal behaviors\" that could affect \"deeply ingrained behavior like handshakes and hugs.\"An internal campaign memo released Thursday instructed all staff members to begin working from home starting on Saturday, announced the closing of all offices to the public and said that the campaign would \"hold smaller events like roundtables, house parties, and press statements, as well as virtual events.\" Fund-raisers, the memo said, would \"become virtual fund-raisers indefinitely.\"Mr. Sanders likewise canceled a rally in Cleveland on Tuesday, and his campaign has not scheduled any new public events. Jane Sanders, Mr. Sanders's wife, told reporters on Thursday after he concluded his remarks that he would return to the Senate after the debate, and that he would stay in Washington.Still, surrogates are continuing to make the rounds in key upcoming contests, and volunteers may be encouraged to head to states like Illinois and Georgia to help with activities like door-knocking, according to Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and a Biden supporter who has been in touch with the campaign.The remarks on Thursday were not the first time Mr. Biden has sought to assume the mantle of a sober, statesmanlike leader through a highly produced speech: In January, he delivered a sharp rebuke of Mr. Trump's stewardship of tensions with Iran against a backdrop that appeared reminiscent of the White House briefing room.Yet that issue faded from the national forefront, and Mr. Biden went on to a fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses a few weeks later as he competed against what was, at the time, a crowded and competitive Democratic field.He entered this speech, however, having amassed a big delegate advantage, and facing just one Democratic opponent, Mr. Sanders.Katie Glueck reported from Wilmington, Del., and Sydney Ember from Burlington, Vt.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R.

He has refused to release State Department documents demanded by impeachment investigators in the House and has declined to speak in any detail about his own role in the affair.But on several occasions, he has reiterated some of Mr. Trump's positions on potential investigations related to Ukraine. And he has refrained from publicly supporting ambassadors and senior diplomats who have testified before Congress and come under attack by Mr. Trump. That has contributed to a sharp drop in morale at the State Department.Mr. Pompeo intends to \"reaffirm U.S. support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity\" on his trip, the State Department said, a reference to the yearslong war that Ukraine is fighting against a Russian-backed insurgency in the east. The State Department said Mr. Pompeo plans to lay a wreath at the monastery of St. Michael's in Kyiv to \"honor those who have fallen in the Donbass,\" the region where the war is unfolding.Mr. Pompeo also plans to meet with Ukraine's foreign and defense ministers, as well as with religious, civic and business figures, the State Department said.The Democratic-led House impeached Mr. Trump along a party-line vote for abuse of power and obstruction on Dec. 18. The abuse of power article rests on the fact that Mr. Trump pressed Mr. Zelensky for political favors while the White House withheld from Kyiv $391 million of military aid that had been approved by Pentagon and State Department officials and required by Congress.Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky in a July 25 telephone call \"to do us a favor\" by looking into a conspiracy theory about a Democratic National Committee server and Russia-promoted disinformation that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 United States presidential election. Mr. Pompeo was on the call.Mr. Trump also asked Mr. Zelensky to look into unsubstantiated claims that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, engaged in corrupt acts related to his son Hunter and a Ukrainian company.Mr. Pompeo's visit comes a month after Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, visited Kyiv seeking to meet with former Ukrainian prosecutors whose allegations of corruption played a role in Mr. Giuliani's and pro-Trump news organizations' promotion of claims about Mr. Biden and his son.In March, after at least two telephone calls with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Pompeo ordered the recall of the American ambassador to Ukraine, Marie L. Yovanovitch. Mr. Giuliani and associates tied to Ukrainian businesspeople had pushed for the ouster of Ms. Yovanovitch, who was known for promoting anti-corruption efforts in Kyiv.Mr. Pompeo picked a veteran diplomat, William B. Taylor Jr., to replace her as head of mission, but Mr. Taylor became concerned over the summer about the withheld aid, writing in a cable dated Aug. 29 that the administration's action was \"folly.\" Mr. Taylor later testified to Congress, infuriating Mr. Trump.Mr. Taylor was scheduled to leave his post in January, but a close aide to Mr. Pompeo, T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, asked Mr. Taylor to turn over his duties to the deputy chief of mission on Jan. 1, before Mr. Pompeo's arrival, a person with knowledge of the discussion said. That would allow Mr. Pompeo to avoid interacting with Mr. Taylor, who then chose to leave Ukraine on Jan. 2.In late August, Mr. Pompeo joined John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, and Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary, to argue to Mr. Trump in an Oval Office meeting that the White House should release the aid, but Mr. Trump ignored their recommendation. Around the same time, Mr. Trump was told about a whistle-blower complaint filed by a C.I.A. officer on the issue, and separately members of Congress were pressing for the aid to be released. On Sept. 11, Mr. Trump ordered an end to the hold.Two senior State Department officials spoke with reporters on Monday about Mr. Pompeo's upcoming trip, which also includes stops in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Cyprus, but declined to answer repeated questions about the pressure from the White House on Mr. Zelensky.Mr. Pompeo spoke in general terms about the impeachment process when asked about it on \"Fox and Friends\" on Monday. \"Whatever happens here in Washington, the American people should know that President Trump and our national security team are focused on keeping them safe,\" he said.In mid-December, Mr. Pompeo unveiled a personal Twitter account, which added to speculation that he plans to run for Senate from his home state of Kansas. But Mr. Pompeo dismissed the idea. \"As long as President Trump wants me to serve in this capacity, there's still work to do,\" he said. \"I've watched my life take turns that one would never have expected, but it's not something I want to do.\"PhotographPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine was pressured for political favors while the White House withheld from Kyiv $391 million of military aid that had been approved by Congress.

But hours later, Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated it may not persist much longer, saying that she would \"soon\" transmit the two articles of impeachment, though not before Mr. McConnell made public the rules for the process.Mr. McConnell shared his intentions with senators over lunch in the Capitol, declaring that he had the votes he needed -- including among moderate Republicans -- to steamroll over Democratic objections and proceed with the trial that puts off final decisions on whether to consider evidence.That would mean the Senate would tackle those questions only after representatives of the House and the president make opening arguments and senators question both sides.\"We have the votes,\" Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, told reporters afterward. He said he modeled his plan on the procedures used during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, the Senate's only modern precedent.\"All we are doing here is saying we are going to get started in exactly the same way 100 senators agreed to 20 years ago,\" he said. \"What was good enough for President Clinton is good enough for President Trump.\"But this time, both the facts of the case and the politics are far different. Mr. Trump directed a campaign to stonewall the House impeachment inquiry, barring testimony from some of his closest advisers and refusing to provide any documents.Mr. McConnell has promised a speedy acquittal, and Democrats charge that his refusal to hear from witnesses who could bolster the case against the president is tantamount to a cover-up. They are expected to oppose Mr. McConnell's resolution almost unanimously.After weeks of quiet haggling, the majority leader's announcement signaled that the traditionally cordial Senate was poised to begin a proceeding of high historical consequence just as polarized as the more volatile House, which split along party lines in charging Mr. Trump.Ms. Pelosi, returning to the Capitol for the first time in the new year, said she still wanted more detail from Mr. McConnell about what precise procedures he would follow before naming the lawmakers who will prosecute the case.\"It is important that he immediately publish this resolution, so that, as I have said before, we can see the arena in which we will be participating, appoint managers and transmit the articles to the Senate,\" she said in a letter to colleagues released a short time later.She accused Mr. McConnell of being loyal to Mr. Trump rather than the Constitution and pursuing a trial \"designed to deprive senators and the American people of crucial documents and testimony.\"A decision to transmit the articles could come as soon as this week, though a series of Iranian attacks on American forces early Wednesday in Iraq left the exact timing in doubt.For his part, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, promised to force a series of votes on calling John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, and three other witnesses and document requests at the outset of the trial. Republicans could defeat the motions, but Democrats hope that some of them would instead break ranks, unwilling to go on the record against additional fact-finding in a trial of constitutional consequence.\"If you are afraid of the facts, if you are afraid of what would come out, if you want to cover it up, even in something as weighty and serious as impeachment, then you say no witnesses and documents,\" Mr. Schumer said at a news conference.He predicted a handful of Republicans could end up supporting summonses for witnesses like Mr. Bolton or Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, whom Mr. Trump effectively blocked from testifying in the House.But for now, even moderate Republicans and those up for re-election this year were sticking with Mr. McConnell. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have both expressed interest in potentially calling witnesses during the trial, but they have come around to Mr. McConnell's argument that the matter should be debated only after opening arguments.\"I had certainly hoped that over the holidays, Leader McConnell and Senator Schumer would have been able to come to terms of an agreement,\" Ms. Murkowski said on Tuesday. Instead, she conceded, they had become hopelessly \"snarled up\" in the debate over witnesses.The renewed posturing came a day after Mr. Bolton said he would now be willing to testify if subpoenaed by the Senate. Other impeachment witnesses and people close to him have said Mr. Bolton could provide an unflattering account of Mr. Trump's decisions to withhold a White House meeting and almost $400 million in military aid from Ukraine as he sought investigations there that would benefit him politically.At the White House, the president played down Mr. Bolton's significance as a witness, and said that impeachment was perhaps \"the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on our country.\"\"He would know nothing about what we're talking about,\" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Bolton, who left the White House in September amid policy disputes with the president.The House's inquiry concluded in December that Mr. Trump had withheld the White House meeting and security aid as leverage to coerce Ukraine's new president to announce investigations smearing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.The goal, according to an abuse of power charge, was to bolster Mr. Trump's re-election campaign. The president was also charged with obstruction of Congress for his blanket stonewalling of the impeachment inquiry, which the House called an effort by Mr. Trump to conceal his conduct from the legislative branch.It is that stonewalling that has animated Senate Democrats' drive to secure a pledge to include additional witnesses and documents at trial.Unlike in 1999, when testimony from every major witness had already been made public by the time the case came to trial, Mr. Trump has succeeded in withholding from Congress nearly every piece of documentary evidence related to the case and a dozen witnesses with knowledge of his actions.Senate rules require only a simple majority -- 51 senators -- to call witnesses, and with a handful of Republicans professing at least some interest in doing so, additional testimony is still possible. Three witnesses were eventually called in Mr. Clinton's trial, all of whom had been interviewed in the inquiry that led to the charges.But Mr. McConnell's plan offers no such guarantee, and he is betting that once a trial is underway, the desire to bring it swiftly to a close may persuade members of his own party not to join Democrats.\"There will be, I'm sure, intense discussion once you get past phase one about the whole witness issue,\" Mr. McConnell said, playing down Democrats' concerns.With the president's eventual acquittal by the Senate all but certain, both parties have tried to leverage the pause between impeachment and the trial for their own advantage.Democrats argue that it has forced individual Republicans senators to go on the record about their intentions and highlighted what they see as Mr. McConnell's intention to help Mr. Trump hide his wrongdoing. The intervening time, they say, has also allowed for new documents and evidence to become public through news reports and public records requests that the administration refused to hand over.\"Pelosi is very good at this. She will know when the lemon has been fully squeezed,\" said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. \"But at the end of the day, the House impeaches and the Senate tries.\"Some Senate Democrats appear to be losing patience.\"Our best leverage right now over Republicans is votes inside the Senate trial,\" said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. \"We should probably get to the point where we can put Republicans on record as soon as possible.\"Republicans have assailed Democrats for what they contend is political gamesmanship and hypocrisy, after having asserted for weeks that impeaching Mr. Trump was an urgent matter.Republican leaders conducted a whip count to confirm support for the plan in their party. Though they did not publicize the results, it appeared all 53 senators in the Republican conference would vote with Mr. McConnell at the outset of the trial.At least one, however, suggested that he might ultimately side with Democrats during the proceeding and vote to call witnesses.\"Going with the Clinton impeachment process is satisfactory to me because that process did provide, down the road, for an opportunity to hear from witnesses,\" Senator Mitt Romney said. \"And I would like to hear from John Bolton.\"Emily Cochrane and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.PhotographMitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, addressing the procedures for a prospective impeachment trial, said on Tuesday: \"What was good enough for President Clinton is good enough for President Trump.\" Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, is under increasing pressure to deliver to the Senate the charges voted against Mr. Trump.

Around the country, Latino Democrats are seeking the candidate who is best poised to take on President Trump, who many believe has placed a target on their own backs with his anti-immigrant rhetoric. These voters, far from a monolith but united on some key issues, will cast their ballots in Texas exactly seven months after the deadliest anti-Latino attack in modern American history took place in El Paso.\"It's hard to be Latino right now,\" said Christian Arana, the policy director for the Latino Community Foundation, a philanthropic group based in California. \"There are so many of us who feel we have to constantly be on the watch for something terrible. People are channeling their anger into voting in a way we have not seen historically.\"Polls have consistently shown that Latino voters in Texas and California list health care, economic inequality and immigration as their top issues. But the upcoming primaries are likely to show the splits and contradictions among the group. Interviews with dozens of Latino voters in El Paso and Los Angeles in recent days show that though Mr. Sanders has built up a loyal base among Latinos, particularly younger and working-class voters, there are many lifelong Democrats who are still searching for a moderate alternative.\"It's a historic moment and a historic disappointment because yet again we are the most underinvested community from the establishment and the big donors and yet still in every election, the Latino voting segment keeps growing,\" said Héctor Sánchez Barba, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, which does Latino voter outreach throughout the country. In 2018, Latino voters helped flip several Congressional districts to the Democrats.Now, he said, is the time Latino groups are pressing to get more promises from candidates on what they will do on health care, education and immigration.Democratic candidates have made more of an effort in recent weeks to court Latino voters, recognizing the decisive role they could play on Super Tuesday. No other candidate has put more effort into courting Latinos than Senator Bernie Sanders, who has made it clear that he is counting on Latinos as a kind of firewall on Tuesday, nationally and particularly in California. So far, recent surveys seem to reflect that effort: Mr. Sanders has a significant lead among Latino voters in both Texas and California, ahead of his rivals by double digits.\"We've lived in fear for our families for the last three years,\" said Janette Espino, a 26-year-old sports merchandising buyer from Long Beach, Calif., who attended a rally for Mr. Sanders in Los Angeles Sunday. Ms. Espino said health care was the most important issue for her, but added that she has several family members who are undocumented immigrants. She said several of other family members had become citizens in the last two years and planned to cast their first ballot Tuesday, choosing Mr. Sanders. \"We've never had a candidate for president who listened to us like this, who we are really excited about.\"Seeming to recognize the need for more of an effort targeting the Latino community, Joseph R. Biden Jr. held rallies in Texas leading up to Super Tuesday, and touted the endorsement of Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of El Paso. And on Saturday, four former Latino cabinet secretaries from the Clinton and Obama administrations published a letter in La Opinion, Los Angeles' largest Spanish-language newspaper, urging their \"Latino brothers and sisters\" to vote for Mr. Biden, arguing that they \"know Joe\" and that he is \"running to restore the American dream.\"Former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has poured in a record-breaking amount of money into Spanish-language advertising in California and Texas. Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has focused particularly on finding local endorsements from heavily Latino regions and featuring those leaders in \"Ganamos Con Mike\" advertisements.Like Mr. Sanders's campaign, Mr. Bloomberg has opened field offices in heavily Latino regions that have long been ignored in presidential elections, such as the Central Valley and the Inland Empire in California. The campaign has also sent millions of campaign mailers to Hispanic voters in both states.\"What used to happen was you avoided talking about Latinos until Florida,\" said Mayra Macías, the executive director of Latino Victory Fund, which tries to get more Latinos elected and backed Mr. Biden last month. \"Now we are seeing that there is no path to victory without speaking holistically to them.\"In some ways, California Latinos began their steady march to political power after Proposition 187, an anti-immigrant ballot initiative approved by voters in 1994. Dozens of current Latino elected officials in the state became engaged in activism during the protests against the measure, which was eventually struck down by the courts. And many in California believe that Texas Latinos are in the midst of a similar political transformation.It has now been nearly seven months since the shooting at an El Paso Walmart. The white 21-year-old gunman, Patrick Crusius, turned a Saturday morning in the binational, majority-Hispanic border city into a scene of horror: He killed 22 people and wounded nearly two dozen others. Most of those killed or injured were either Mexicans or Mexican-Americans.Minutes before the shooting, the gunman had posted an anti-immigrant manifesto online, declaring that the attack was in response to \"the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\" He wrote that he feared that the Hispanic population in Texas would make it a Democratic stronghold that would \"win nearly every presidential election.\"For 27-year-old Elisa Tamayo, the shooting last year was personal. It was her neighborhood Walmart, a place to shop and meet her family from across the border. One of her mother's friends was killed in the attack -- Maria Eugenia Legarreta Rothe, 58, from the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Ms. Tamayo called her \"tía,\" Spanish for aunt, although they were not related.But for Ms. Tamayo, the attack has since veered to the political.She is running for public office for the first time in her life, pushed in part by the Walmart shooting and the rhetoric from President Trump and state Republican leaders that she believes fueled the anti-Latino hatred of the gunman. Ms. Tamayo is vying to become a Democratic lawmaker in the state House of Representatives and to represent the House district that includes the Walmart. She announced her candidacy eight weeks after the shooting, standing with relatives and supporters in front of a mural reading \"El Paso Strong.\"Ms. Tamayo, who is on the Democratic primary ballot in El Paso on Tuesday and who voted for Ms. Warren for president, said that in knocking on doors for her campaign, she has seen firsthand a new level of engagement of Hispanic voters.\"We've been knocking on doors for more than three months, and I keep hearing that they want to vote in this election,\" she said. \"They really want to vote in this election because they feel like we've got to get Trump out of office. Instead of saying my vote doesn't matter, I think people are now more willing to show up and more willing to vote because of that.\"Around El Paso, many people described similar reasons for voting: Mr. Trump's rhetoric and the shooting last summer. But they came to different conclusions about their preferred candidates.Anna Casas, 33, a single mother and home health aide in El Paso, voted for the first time in her life last week -- her vote went to Mr. Sanders, and she had registered to vote last year about three months after the attack at the Walmart, where she would often shop with her three sons. \"What about if we were there and that happened?\" she said. \"It did open my eyes. It pushed me to vote.\"Ms. Casas said it was clear to her that Mr. Trump's words fueled the shooter's hatred of Hispanics.\"I'm trying to push other people to vote, because they think that their vote doesn't matter,\" she said. \"But it actually does. I used to think that way, honestly, until Trump became president.\"Irma Vasquez, 67, a former school-district worker who voted for Mr. Bloomberg, put the role the president's words played in the attack this way, tugging at the skin on her cheek: \"He put a bull's-eye on our backs, especially this color.\"Pedro Gandara, 74, a retired telephone-company repairman and Air Force veteran who voted for Mr. Biden, said Mr. Trump evokes for him the anti-Latino racism he has faced his entire life. He remembered being refused service at a restaurant in the Panhandle city of Amarillo when he was a high school student.\"This was '63 or '64, so the racism has been here ever since, but Trump has really brought it out,\" Mr. Gandara said. \"He's very much against us all.\"Perhaps no one exemplified the split of Latino Democratic voters in Texas heading into Super Tuesday better than the Balcazar family.Last Wednesday, Miguel Balcazar, 66, a retired middle-school history teacher, walked slowly to an early voting site at a recreation center in the city's Mission Valley neighborhood, a little more than two miles from the scene of the Walmart shooting. He used a cane because of his knee problems as his wife, Lucinda, 65, a retired special-education teacher's assistant, walked alongside him, just as slowly. They've been married for 41 years.They were making their way cautiously to vote, but they were eager for political revolution. When they got back to their car wearing \"I voted\" stickers, both said they had supported Mr. Sanders.\"I feel strongly that he's more radical than anything else,\" Mr. Balcazar said of Mr. Sanders.Their three sons were not with them, but their parents know exactly how they will vote. One of their sons plans on voting for Mr. Sanders, one is undecided and the other will vote for Mr. Trump, a sign of the Hispanic Republican support for the president that exists in a conservative state like Texas.\"I can't change his mind,\" Mr. Balcazar said, shaking his head and adding with a chuckle, \"He says, 'Dad, I'm going to put the sign up on top of your roof, because you can't get up there anymore.\"'Jennifer Medina reported from Los Angeles, and Manny Fernandez from El Paso.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders, campaigning in San Jose, Calif., left, has built up a loyal base of younger and working-class Latino voters.

(The president repaid the favor on Monday, with his campaign saying he would appear at a rally in Mr. Van Drew's district on Jan. 28.)\"Too many of our leaders have lost their moral compass,\" she said in the video clip. \"Trump and Van Drew are symptoms of a bigger sickness infecting our country and our politics.\"Ms. Kennedy's husband is a former Rhode Island congressman and the son of former Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts.Mr. Van Drew, a first-term congressman who was elected as a conservative Democrat, represents a district the Republican president won by about 5 points in 2016.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Ms. Kennedy, in the brief video, touched on what are likely to form the broad themes of her campaign: civility, climate change, mental health and addiction, and corporate tax incentives.\"We continue to ignore the biggest public health emergency of our time -- the mental health and addiction crisis that affects virtually every family,\" she said.She added, \"People in South Jersey can't find good jobs, but the richest corporations pay almost no taxes.\"Ms. Kennedy, who lives north of Atlantic City in Brigantine, could not be reached for comment.If Ms. Kennedy were to win the nomination, she would not be the only Kennedy campaigning for Congress. Representative Joe Kennedy III, the grandson of the former attorney general, Robert F. Kennedy, is running for the Senate from Massachusetts.Four other Democrats have already entered the primary race in the Second Congressional District, which cuts across New Jersey's southernmost counties and stretches from Cape May to the Pennsylvania border.Brigid Callahan Harrison, a professor who teaches political science at Montclair State University, announced her candidacy the same week Mr. Van Drew said he would join the Republicans, a shift that prompted most of his staff members to quit.Professor Harrison was quickly endorsed by many of the Democratic Party leaders in the district who hold sway over whose name will appear on the party's coveted ballot line in the June primary.Ashley Bennett, a freeholder representing Atlantic County who appeared on a 2018 cover of Time magazine with other progressive women, also has announced she is running for the Democratic nomination for the congressional seat.Ms. Bennett has said she intends to focus on issues affecting New Jersey's working class, and is likely to draw support from the state's increasingly active grass-roots organizations.John Francis III, a commissioner in West Cape May, and Robert Turkavage, a former F.B.I. agent who last month switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party, have also announced they will run in the Democratic primary.At least three Republicans, including David Richter, a former businessman who has said he will spend $1 million of his own money on his campaign, also are expected to compete against Mr. Van Drew for the Republican nomination.Benjamin A. Dworkin, a professor of political science at Rowan University and the director of the school's Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, said Ms. Kennedy's entry into the race had the potential to change the playing field.He noted that the Democratic candidates' success at raising campaign funds is likely to be key to the primary race and the general election, especially in southern New Jersey, which is within the pricey Philadelphia media market.Professor Harrison's support from established Democratic Party leaders in the area will presumably help her fund-raising efforts, he said, and the Kennedy family's network of donors is expected to work to Ms. Kennedy's advantage.\"There is an established Kennedy fund-raising network that she will be able to tap into and will allow her to be well financed in this race, which really matters,\" Dr. Dworkin said.A candidate's ability to independently generate funds is even more crucial in a year when the national Democratic organization is likely to be focused on protecting the three other congressional seats that the party flipped in 2018 in New Jersey swing districts, he said.\"Democrats don't need it as much as they did in 2018,\" Dr. Dworkin said. \"You could lose Van Drew's seat and still maintain the majority, so it's not nearly as critical.\"Professor Harrison said she welcomed all opponents.\"The more the merrier,\" she said. \"This is healthy for our democracy. Primaries are important. It's a way for parties to flesh out their views.\"The Democrat who does win is expected to face a major challenge in November's general election in a conservative district that for 24 years before Mr. Van Drew's election was held by a Republican. Last year, Republicans captured several seats in the State Legislature in an election area that overlaps much of Mr. Van Drew's district.Still, Mr. Trump's support for the Republican candidate is also a wild-card factor that could cut both ways in a state where the president remains deeply unpopular.\"This is going to be a very tough race in November,\" Professor Harrison said.PhotographAmy Kennedy, daughter-in-law of former Senator Ted Kennedy.

A version of the legislation, known as the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, passed both the House and Senate this year, but its path to the White House was stalled this month by a procedural process.Human rights causes draw rare bipartisan support in Congress, and many Republican lawmakers have broken from Mr. Trump on the matter, even as they move in lock step with the president on nearly every other issue, including defending him against impeachment.\"There's been a sense by some that the administration hasn't prioritized human rights in its broader foreign policy,\" said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. \"I don't think that's necessarily accurate -- but that sense has grown. There's been a sense that Congress needs to step up.\"Last month, Congress passed legislation by unanimous consent supporting the Hong Kong protests, forcing Mr. Trump to sign the bill. Mr. Trump, who had previously said he was \"standing with\" Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, risked being overruled by Congress and criticized as weak on China if he vetoed the measure. Still, when Mr. Trump signed the bill the night before Thanksgiving, he issued a statement saying he would \"exercise executive discretion\" in enforcing its provisions.Lawmakers this year also passed legislation recognizing the 1915 killings of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians as a genocide over the objections of Mr. Trump. And they approved a resolution calling for the end of American military support of the war in Yemen, in which a Saudi Arabia-led coalition is bombing civilians. Mr. Trump vetoed the measure.In October, after Mr. Trump withdrew American forces just inside Syria's border, paving the way for a Turkish military operation against Kurdish forces, lawmakers voted to rebuke the administration for the decision and show support for the Kurds, a persecuted group in the Middle East that has fought with American troops against the Islamic State.In the coming months, Congress is expected to try to pass legislation that would punish Turkey and Saudi Arabia for human rights abuses, though it is unclear whether those efforts would have a veto-proof majority. The effort includes a package of Turkey sanctions sponsored by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, and Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. The legislation, which would penalize those who commit human rights abuses in Syria, was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December.Some human rights issues draw greater bipartisan support than others. China hawks have become ascendant across Congress and in the administration, and many Americans increasingly see China as a threat.Although Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have criticized China on the persecution of Muslims, Mr. Trump has said nothing. In July, Jewher Ilham, the daughter of Ilham Tohti, a Uighur professor whom China sentenced to life in prison in 2014, joined other victims of religious persecution to meet with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office. When she tried to explain the camps to Mr. Trump, he appeared ignorant of the situation and simply said, \"That's tough stuff.\"\"It's hard to find evidence of genuine personal interest,\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \"On China, at a minimum, President Trump should stop describing an authoritarian, abusive leader as a 'terrific guy'; doing so gives Chinese authorities the opportunity to choose between that characterization and the far tougher ones offered up by other senior U.S. officials.\"Mr. Trump, who has criticized China over its economic practices, has refrained from imposing sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for the camps for fear of jeopardizing the chances of reaching a trade deal. Many top aides and lawmakers from both parties have pushed for sanctions, but the Treasury Department has opposed the penalties. The Uighur act, which had Mr. Rubio and Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, as sponsors, would compel Mr. Trump to impose sanctions on Chen Quanguo, the top Communist Party official in Xinjiang, where the camps are.In October, the Trump administration placed a few Chinese businesses and security organizations on a commercial blacklist because of their suspected roles in Muslim abuses, but many analysts considered that a weak punishment.Other countries are more complicated. Saudi Arabia has been a traditional American ally, and Iran hawks in Congress, who are generally Republican, argue Riyadh is a regional bulwark against Tehran. And Mr. Trump's positive declarations about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have spurred a gradual shift from the anti-Russia views previously held by Republican politicians, conservative voters and right-wing news organizations.Mr. Trump expresses open admiration for many authoritarian leaders, even those condemned by senior officials in his own administration for some of the world's worst atrocities. They include Mr. Xi, Mr. Putin, Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, and President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil.\"He's celebrating the leaders who are the worst human rights abusers,\" Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said in an interview. \"It almost seems like the president's support for you is directly proportional to how brutal you are to your citizenry.\"This month, the Trump administration blocked a move by members of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the human rights situation in North Korea for the second year in a row. Mr. Trump has expressed warmth for Mr. Kim of North Korea and has engaged in personal diplomacy, meeting him at two summits to try, without success, to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\"The Trump administration has sent a clear message to Pyongyang and to the rest of the world that this administration doesn't consider starvation, torture, summary executions and a host of other crimes to be a priority,\" said Louis Charbonneau, United Nations director at Human Rights Watch.On other prominent issues this year, Mr. Trump used his executive power to reject measures that would have either punished countries for human rights abuses or simply affirmed the abuses were happening.Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution that would have punished Saudi Arabia for its air war in Yemen and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist and permanent resident of the United States. Mr. Khashoggi's death last year -- a grisly killing that American intelligence officials have said was ordered by Prince Mohammed -- reignited a long-simmering effort among a small group of lawmakers to cut off American support for the Saudi-led bombings in Yemen that have helped create the world's worst man-made humanitarian crisis.Four of the six vetoes Mr. Trump has issued in his presidency overturned legislative attempts to penalize the kingdom. In May, Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo sparked bipartisan fury by declaring an emergency over Iran that allowed the United States to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, bypassing a congressional hold on the sales. This fall, in closed door negotiations, the White House blocked similar language from making it into the final version of the annual defense policy bill, a must-pass package of legislation.\"I'm a big fan of the president on many fronts, but on this, someone has to stand up,\" Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky and a proponent of withdrawing the United States from wars, said in a floor speech in June before voting to cut off arms sales to the kingdom.In another recent instance that privately confounded Republican lawmakers, the White House recruited multiple Republican senators to block attempts to pass legislation formally recognizing the Armenian genocide. The administration argued the timing of the bill would upend diplomatic relations with Turkey, including when Mr. Trump received Mr. Erdogan at the White House in November. Mr. Trump insisted on holding that meeting over the objections of some Republicans who have criticized Turkey, a NATO ally, for attacking the Kurds in Syria.The legislation finally passed this month, days after the Senate advanced a package of sanctions related to Mr. Erdogan's invasion of northern Syria and his purchase of a sophisticated Russian surface-to-air missile system.PhotographA protest on Sunday in Hong Kong in support of Muslim Uighurs, who face repression and detention in camps under policies set by the central government in Beijing.

Here's a fact check.\"A corrupt politician named Adam Schiff made up my statement to the Ukrainian president. He brought it out of thin air. Just made it up.\"This is exaggerated. For months, Mr. Trump has decried a re-enactment of his July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, read aloud by Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.At a hearing in September, Mr. Schiff said he was conferring \"the essence\" of the conversation and later clarified that his summary of the call \"was meant to be at least part in parody.\" But he spoke in first person, leaving the impression that he was quoting Mr. Trump.On Thursday, Mr. Trump took particular umbrage at one of Mr. Schiff's erroneous lines in the parody: \"By the way, don't call me again. I'll call you when you've done what I asked.\" According to the reconstructed transcript of the call, Mr. Trump said the opposite to Mr. Zelensky: \"Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel free to call.\"But while Mr. Schiff's account at points veered from the transcript in chronology and details, it generally tracked with the transcript's version of what Mr. Trump said on the call (for example, his description of Mr. Zelensky's interest in a meeting and purchasing weapons, and Mr. Trump's asking for a \"favor\"). It was not fabricated \"out of thin air.\"\"They said they didn't add this word. I said, 'Add it, they're probably wrong, but add it.' So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate.\"This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump was referring inaccurately to testimony from Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council who heard Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky. Colonel Vindman said that the reconstructed transcript included a few omissions, and that he had tried to make some changes. Some edits were successful, he said, but two \"substantive\" corrections were not made.On the fourth page of the transcript, Mr. Trump said former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \"went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into that ...\"According to his notes, Colonel Vindman said, the ellipses took the place of Mr. Trump saying \"there are recordings.\"On that same page, the transcript recorded Mr. Zelensky promising that Ukraine's next prosecutor general would \"look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue.\"But Mr. Zelensky explicitly said Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company where Mr. Biden's son worked, and not \"the company,\" according to Colonel Vindman.\"I think that's when Comey announced he was leaking, lying and everything else, right?\"False. As Mr. Trump praised Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, he claimed that Mr. Grassley's questioning of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, in May 2017 resulted in Mr. Comey confessing to the misdeeds Mr. Trump has long accused him of. But Mr. Comey had said the exact opposite, denying that he had leaked classified information:Mr. Grassley: \"Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?\"\n","\n","Mr. Comey: \"Never.\"\n","\n","Mr. Grassley: \"Question two, relatively related, have you ever authorized someone else at the F.B.I. to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?\"\n","\n","Mr. Comey \"No.\"\n","\n","Mr. Grassley: \"Has any classified information relating to President Trump or his association -- associates been declassified and shared with the media?\"\n","\n","Mr. Comey: \"Not to my knowledge.\"\"Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying the money?\"This is misleading. Mr. Trump was talking about international aid to Ukraine. Those European countries are, in fact, contributing to Ukraine's efforts to counteract Russian aggression. They provide more development and humanitarian aid to Ukraine than the United States does, though the United States is the largest provider of military assistance.European countries have contributed $1.6 billion in development assistance from 2014 to 2017, compared with $807 million from the United States, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\"We just won two seats in North Carolina, two wonderful seats in North Carolina that were not supposed to be won.\"This is exaggerated. Two Republicans, Representatives Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, won their special House elections in September. Contrary to Mr. Trump's claim that his party pulled off upset victories, both districts were conservative strongholds.Republicans have held Mr. Bishop's district, North Carolina's Ninth, since the 1960s. Mr. Murphy won his seat after the February 2019 death of Walter B. Jones Jr., a Republican who had represented the Third District since 1995. Mr. Trump carried both congressional districts by wide margins of 12 percent and 24 percent.\"We are putting up walls in New Mexico, too; a state that has never been in play for Republicans is totally in play, right?\"This is exaggerated. Mr. Trump has a point that the state has largely voted for Democratic presidential candidates in the past two decades, but he goes too far to say it has \"never been in play for Republicans.\"Since New Mexico became a state in 1912, it voted for 15 Democratic presidential candidates and 12 Republican candidates, most recently George W. Bush in 2004. According to the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, the state currently leans Democratic for the 2020 presidential election.\"Matt said, like five years ago, six years ago, and I made a speech. And then they do some kind of a straw poll. Who made the best speech? And he said I made the best speech.\"False. Mr. Trump was addressing Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, which hosts the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. But he had never won the straw poll at CPAC before he became president.Ron Paul, the libertarian and former Texas congressman, won in 2011, and Mr. Trump, a write-in candidate who received about 1 percent of the votes, did not crack the top 15. Senator Mitt Romney of Utah won in 2012; Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky in 2013, 2014 (Mr. Trump tied for 14th place) and 2015 (Mr. Trump came in eighth place); and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in 2016 (Mr. Trump came in third).CPAC retired the poll for 2017 and 2018, but Mr. Trump did come in first place in 2019 with 82 percent of the votes, with Mr. Romney trailing in second at 6 percent.\"We had first time in 51 years where drug prices actually came down last year, first time in 51 years.\"This is misleading. The Consumer Price Index for prescription drugs has declined under Mr. Trump, most recently in September. But that measure does not include all prescription drugs. Nor was it the \"first time in 51 years\" that the index had declined -- it did so as well in December 2013, under the Obama administration. And it has risen since September.Other analyses show that drug prices have continued to rise, albeit at a slower rate than in the past. GoodRx, a website that tracks costs, has found that 639 drugs have so far increased by an average of 6 percent. That's in line with other surveys from 3 Axis Advisors, a consultancy firm that estimated an average rise of 5.3 percent this year, and Rx Savings Solutions, a company that advises employers on how to reduce drug costs, which found an average 6.9 percent increase on more than 2,500 drugs.Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

A week ago, the campaign filed a similar action against The New York Times.President Trump's re-election campaign sued The Washington Post for libel on Tuesday, citing two opinion articles from last year that linked Mr. Trump to Russian election interference. The action came a week after Mr. Trump's campaign filed a similar lawsuit against The New York Times.Mr. Trump's attacks on news organizations have been a defining mark of his presidency, and The Post has been one of his frequent targets. In 2017, the newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles by David Farenthold that examined Mr. Trump's philanthropic claims. The president has often belittled The Post and its owner, Jeff Bezos, the billionaire Amazon founder, who bought it in 2013.The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington, centers on two opinion articles from a Post blog called The Plum Line that accused the 2016 Trump election campaign of inviting help from foreign governments. The Post's opinion section operates separately from its newsroom.In one post, published on June 13, Greg Sargent wrote that Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, had \"concluded that Trump and/or his campaign eagerly encouraged, tried to conspire with, and happily profited off\" Russia's efforts.In a post on June 20, Paul Waldman wrote: \"Who knows what sort of aid Russia and North Korea will give to the Trump campaign, now that he has invited them to offer their assistance?\" The word \"invited\" in the article was hyperlinked to a transcript of an ABC News interview with Mr. Trump, in which he said he would consider accepting information from a foreign government about a political opponent.The Trump campaign accused The Post of making \"false and defamatory\" statements.\"There has never been any statement by anyone associated with the campaign or the administration 'inviting' Russia or North Korea to assist the campaign in 2019 or beyond,\" the court filing said. \"There also has never been any reporting that the campaign has ever had any contact with North Korea relating to any United States election.\"A spokeswoman for The Post, Kristine Coratti Kelly, said on Tuesday, \"It's disappointing to see the president's campaign committee resorting to these types of tactics, and we will vigorously defend this case.\"Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer at Gibson Dunn who has previously worked on high-profile media cases, said the lawsuit \"flies in the face of basic First Amendment doctrine.\"\"The complaint is attacking opinions where the authors are expressing their views based on widely reported facts,\" he said. \"It's all part of the overarching war on the press.\"Mr. Trump's re-election campaign sued The Times on Feb. 26, claiming that an essay published in the newspaper's Opinion section last March falsely asserted a \"quid pro quo\" between Russian officials and Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign. (Like The Post, The Times's Opinion section is separate from its newsroom.)In both lawsuits, the campaign is represented by Charles J. Harder, a lawyer who has worked on a number of legal battles with news organizations.Mr. Harder is best known for representing Terry G. Bollea, the former professional wrestler known as Hulk Hogan, in a lawsuit that decimated Gawker Media and was secretly underwritten by the tech investor Peter Thiel.He also represented Melania Trump, Mr. Trump's wife, when she sued The Daily Mail, a British tabloid, in 2016 over its report that a modeling agency she had worked for in the 1990s was also an escort service. The Daily Mail later retracted the article and paid damages in a settlement.PhotographA lawsuit filed against The Washington Post, a frequent target of President Trump, centers on two opinion articles.

But however inappropriate his conduct, another conviction overrode the first: Americans would not tolerate the Senate stepping in to substitute its own judgment for that of the voters fewer than 10 months before the next election.\"The Senate reflects the country, and the country is as divided as it has been for a long time,\" Mr. Alexander said Friday during an interview in his Capitol office. \"For the Senate to tear up the ballots in this election and say President Trump couldn't be on it, the country probably wouldn't accept that. It would just pour gasoline on cultural fires that are burning out there.\"With that logic, Mr. Alexander delivered a victory to Mr. Trump -- and to Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, with whom Mr. Alexander has been friends for more than a half-century. In announcing he would vote to block witnesses at Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, he set Mr. Trump on a quick course to his inevitable acquittal.Many Republicans appeared to be following Mr. Alexander's lead on Friday, saying the Tennessee senator had echoed the feelings of their caucus -- and the country.\"Long story short, @SenatorAlexander most likely expressed the sentiments of the country as a whole as well as any single Senator possibly could,\" Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close ally of Mr. Trump's, wrote on Twitter. \"Those who hate Trump and wish to take the voters choice away in an unfounded manner, Sen. Alexander rightly rejected their arguments.\"Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, put it this way: \"Lamar speaks for lots and lots of us.\"Mr. Alexander could easily have gone the other way. He is retiring from the Senate and free to vote as he pleases without political consequences. And he said in the interview that Mr. Trump had done exactly what Democrats had accused him of doing: He withheld military aid from Ukraine to pressure the country to investigate his political rival -- a move he could not condone.\"I think he did something that was clearly inappropriate,\" Mr. Alexander said. \"I think it is inappropriate for the president to ask the leader of a foreign nation to investigate a leading political rival, which the president says he did. I think it is inappropriate at least in part to withhold aid to encourage that investigation.\"\"But that is not treason, that is not bribery, that is not a high crime and misdemeanor,\" he added, listing the criteria enumerated in the Constitution for impeachable offenses.It is hardly a surprise that Mr. Alexander is effectively coming down on both sides. Widely respected as a Senate \"institutionalist\" -- a guardian of its traditions -- he is a product of a bygone time in Republican politics: the pre-Trump era, when lawmakers worked across the political aisle to forge consensus on matters of national importance.A former governor, university president and secretary of education, Mr. Alexander has modeled himself on Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., another Tennessee Republican, who turned against President Richard M. Nixon during Watergate. Mr. Baker, who died in 2014, introduced Mr. Alexander to Mr. McConnell in 1969, when Mr. Alexander was an aide in the Nixon White House and Mr. McConnell was a legislative assistant to a Kentucky senator.Few friendships in the Capitol have been as enduring as theirs. Today Mr. McConnell calls Mr. Alexander \"my best friend in the Senate.\" But Mr. Alexander said he did not give Mr. McConnell -- whom he described, aptly, as \"a person of few words\" -- advance notice of his vote.\"I know what he thinks, and he knows that is not the way to influence my decisions,\" Mr. Alexander said.Yet Mr. McConnell did not really have to ask. Although Mr. Alexander was lumped in with three other Republicans -- Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah -- who had expressed openness to witnesses, it was clear early on that he was unlikely to vote to include them.Those close to him say he does not relish shaking things up.\"I think that Lamar has been able to successfully navigate the ins and outs of the new administration because Lamar is very wise in how he shares, when he shares, any disagreement or policy difference he might have with the administration,\" said Tom Griscom, a close friend of Mr. Alexander's who worked as Mr. Baker's press secretary. \"He's not looking to be out on the front edge of it.\"Another close friend, Tom Ingram, who ran Mr. Alexander's Senate races and served as his chief of staff, said he was not surprised by Mr. Alexander's decision. He said Mr. Alexander was troubled by what he regarded as a highly partisan impeachment process in the House, and wanted to assure that the Senate gave it thorough consideration, which was why he had expressed openness to witnesses.\"Knowing the reverence he holds for the presidency -- the office, not the person -- and for the Senate process and how seriously he takes impeachment, it was going to have to be very clear in his mind that the offense clearly fit the high bar set in the Constitution.\"With 47 Democratic votes (including those of two independents who caucus with them), Senate Democrats would need four Republicans to cross party lines in order to force the Senate to subpoena witnesses and fresh documents. In the end, it appears, they will fall short by two. Ms. Collins and Mr. Romney have said they will vote in favor of witnesses.A little more than 12 hours after Mr. Alexander had declared his intentions, Ms. Murkowski said Friday that she, too, would vote against.\"Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,\" she said in a statement. \"I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything.\"\"It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed,\" Ms. Murkowski added.Unlike Mr. Alexander, she did not pass judgment on Mr. Trump's behavior. Mr. Alexander's decision to do so gave Democrats a boost.\"He came to the wrong conclusions about hearing evidence in this trial, that's clear,\" Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told reporters on Friday. \"But Senator Alexander, a senior Senate Republican, a retiring member, said out loud what I think most Senate Republicans believe in private: That yes, the president did withhold military assistance to try to get Ukraine to help with his election.\"Even so, Mr. Alexander told NPR that he supported Mr. Trump's re-election.In the interview with The New York Times, he said voters should take the charges against Mr. Trump into account, but offered a pointed contrast between the president and his would-be Democratic challengers, specifically mentioning Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, an icon of the progressive left who is a leading contender in her party's nominating contest.\"Whatever you think of his behavior,\" Mr. Alexander said of Mr. Trump, \"with the terrific economy, with conservative judges, with fewer regulations, you add in there an inappropriate call with the president of Ukraine, and you decide if you prefer him or Elizabeth Warren.\"PhotographConvicting the president \"would just pour gasoline on cultural fires that are burning out there,\" said Senator Lamar Alexander, center.

Trump's 2016 campaign that at rallies his supporters would chant the three words representing his pledge to take on big donors and special interests: \"Drain the swamp.\"But as President Trump ramps up his 2020 re-election bid, it is clear that he has tolerated if not fostered a swamp of his own in Washington, granting up-close access to deep-pocketed supporters and interest groups willing to write six- and seven-figure checks to his political operation. Some have used the opportunity to plead their cases directly to him.The latest evidence came over the weekend, with the release of a secret recording of an April 2018 dinner for major donors and prospective donors to a super PAC supporting Mr. Trump.While news of the recording primarily focused on Mr. Trump's call for the removal of Marie L. Yovanovitch as ambassador to Ukraine after a donor claimed she had disparaged the president, the recording revealed that Mr. Trump engaged in policy discussions with many other donors pushing their own agendas.There was the New York real estate developer whose company's project in South Korea was proposed to Mr. Trump as a possible site for his summit with Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea.There was the Canadian steel magnate who pushed the president to further limit steel imports to the United States, and whose companies donated $1.75 million to the super PAC.Other attendees discussed government policies that could benefit their businesses, including building a highway for self-driving trucks and regulations that would help make trucks powered by gas compressors to be more competitive with electric-powered vehicles.The recording is a glimpse into a broader pattern in which the administration appointed industry lobbyists to key policymaking jobs, heeded the deregulatory wishes of big corporations and granted regular access to donors and influential political supporters. Some of the policies sought by the donors at the 2018 dinner have been subsequently introduced in Congress; it is unclear in those cases whether the president or the White House intervened.In other cases, Mr. Trump has directly championed the businesses of some of his biggest donors, as he did in the weeks after his inauguration when he reportedly discussed with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan an effort by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson to build a casino there.Mr. Trump's assiduous courtship of major donors closely mirrors behavior for which he chastised his opponents in 2016, when he cast himself as a billionaire whose ability to finance his own campaign would ensure that he was not beholden to financial backers.In the months after starting his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump branded his Republican rivals, as well as his eventual Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton, as \"puppets\" of major donors who funded their campaigns and supportive super PACs.In one characteristic broadside at his rivals in late 2015, he assailed Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, and Senator Marco Rubio, also of Florida, both of whom were seeking the Republican nomination at the time, for their embrace of super PACs funded by major donors.\"And you look at Hillary -- let's go to the other side -- they have super PACs, where they control the candidate just like you control a puppet,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We don't want anybody to form super PACs for me. We sent legal notices: 'Please give all the money back.' We don't want it.\"It was not long before Mr. Trump reversed himself.His campaign began aggressively courting donations to supplement the personal money he was spending on his 2016 bid, and his team eventually blessed the formation of a super PAC that solicited large checks from major donors to air ads attacking Mrs. Clinton.Once elected, Mr. Trump's team signaled that he did not intend to spend his own money on his re-election. His allies formed a pair of political groups using variations of the name America First that could accept unlimited donations. He began appearing at events for donors, the most generous of whom were invited to the White House for briefings with top administration officials.He has attended many donor gatherings and fund-raisers have been held at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, including the dinner that was the subject of the recording released over the weekend. Held in a private suite on April 30, 2018, it was for donors and prospective donors to America First Action, a super PAC that has raised nearly $50 million to support Mr. Trump and allied candidates.The recording, which includes video at times, shows Mr. Trump entering the suite and posing for some photographs before joining donors in a dining room with 16 plush chairs around an ornately set table accented with floral arrangements.Mr. Trump updated the donors on some of the most pressing issues facing his administration, including its ongoing negotiations with China over trade and North Korea over nuclear weapons. He seemed to encourage the donors to share their concerns.Mr. Trump mentioned to the donors that his administration had selected a date and a location for his first meeting with Mr. Kim, which would be held in Singapore in the weeks after the dinner. One of the dinner attendees suggested a different site for the summit: a so-called smart development outside Seoul, South Korea, called Songdo, featuring a convention center, apartments and a golf course designed by the golfer Jack Nicklaus.A leading stakeholder in the development was a company run by Stanley C. Gale, a donor to Republican campaigns and committees who attended the dinner, according to people familiar with the event. It was also attended by the golfer's grandson and namesake, Jack Nicklaus III, who works for Mr. Gale's company, according to a LinkedIn profile. Mr. Gale did not respond to a request for comment.During the discussion, Mr. Trump told the guests, \"You know that Kim Jong-un is a great golfer.\" His remark prompted laughter and led another guest to suggest that Mr. Kim's scores were recorded as all holes-in-one in his authoritarian country.Another guest was Barry Zekelman, a Canadian citizen who owned a United States-based steel-tube manufacturing company that donated $1.75 million to America First Action, avoiding running afoul of a ban on foreign donations in American politics. He used the dinner to push the president on two challenges facing his company: cheap steel tube imports from Asia and new federal rules that made it harder to find truck drivers.He urged Mr. Trump to go further in his effort to limit steel imports to the United States and questioned the rules intended to prevent fatal truck accidents by using electronic monitoring systems to limit the hours drivers could be on the road.\"Say someone is half an hour from home on their long-haul truck -- they literally have to pull over on the side of the road and stop,\" Mr. Zekelman said. \"They can't go home.\"Mr. Trump did not seem to be aware of the new federal rules that required those monitoring systems.\"They have a method that you shut down a truck?\" Mr. Trump said, after Mr. Zekelman questioned the effect the new rules had on his ability to move the steel pipe he manufactured. \"Wow.\"Since that dinner, legislation has been introduced in the House with the cosponsorship of 12 Republicans, including the brother of Vice President Mike Pence, to allow smaller trucking companies to get exemptions from the rule.Legislation has also been introduced to help natural gas vehicles compete with electric ones. It was applauded by an Ohio company that makes gas compressors, Ariel Corporation. One of its executives, Thomas Rastin, was on the invitation list for the April dinner. He and a woman resembling his wife, Karen Buchwald Wright, who owns Ariel Corporation, are briefly visible in the video of the event. Together, the couple have donated a combined $875,000 to America First Action. He did not respond to questions about whether he was the voice on the recording urging the president to take steps to help the industry.Another invitee was Wayne Hoovestol, who owns trucking companies in the Midwest, including one that works with the United States Postal Service. On the recording, a male voice says he runs a company that does business with the Postal Service and urges Mr. Trump to consider supporting the construction of a 500-mile section of highway to be used exclusively by self-driving trucks.Paying truck drivers, the voice said, was one of his company's biggest costs.\"All the technology is there, right now,\" he said. \"It is absolutely safe.\"A limited liability company that shared an address and personnel with one of Mr. Hoovestol's companies donated $250,000 to America First Action on the day of the dinner.Mr. Hoovestol did not respond to a request for comment.The recording was made by a dinner attendee, Igor Fruman, and was released by the lawyer for another, Lev Parnas, an associate of Mr. Fruman.The two, both Soviet-born American businessmen, would go on to play central roles in the pressure campaign against Ukraine that led to Mr. Trump's impeachment.During the dinner, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman discussed with Mr. Trump a natural gas venture they were pursuing in Ukraine. Mr. Parnas also asked the president to consider changing banking regulations to aid another business venture they would soon pursue: a plan to win marijuana retail licenses in Nevada and elsewhere.The month after the dinner, they donated $325,000 to America First Action through Global Energy Producers, a company they had recently formed to pursue energy deals.The men have since been indicted on campaign finance charges related to their business ventures and have pleaded not guilty.Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York.PhotographPresident Trump speaking to a group of mayors at the White House on Friday.

Trump was slashing through a field of more seasoned candidates and Hillary Clinton appeared to have a good shot at becoming the first female president. Americans were transfixed, and a number of advertising campaigns capitalized on the growing interest in an unusual race.A Chrysler commercial starred a pair of actors known for their portrayals of fictional White House occupants: Martin Sheen (President Jed Bartlet of \"The West Wing\") and Bill Pullman (President Thomas Whitmore of \"Independence Day\").An ad for Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant chain based in Boston, presented the company's chief executive, Roger Berkowitz, in a mock campaign poster with a slogan that referenced a Trump campaign promise: \"If we build a wall on the border, who will eat our delicious fish tacos?\"Four years later, things have changed. The environment for advertising is \"more scary than exciting,\" said Ellis Verdi, the president of DeVito/Verdi, the agency that created the Legal Sea Foods ad, and most companies no longer see an upside in weighing in on politics, even jokingly.\"There's fear, as opposed to the entertainment that was associated with the horse race a couple of years ago,\" Mr. Verdi said. \"Even free expression is a challenge right now. People are holding their hands over their eyes and ears a little bit. This is not the moment for advertisers to take risks.\"With impeachment in the news and the 2020 campaign sparking nasty hashtags on social media, it has become routine for companies to reject pitches for ads that even touch on politics. They have also asked that their ads be placed far from candidates' campaign spots.\"It's like McCarthyism -- people are too frickin' scared to say anything,\" said Gaston Legorburu, a longtime advertising executive who founded the agency Glue IQ. \"I've seen briefs where on Page 1 they're telling you to, by all means, stay away from anything that is political.\"In the digital sphere, companies are taking steps to make sure that their ads do not appear next to content that includes keywords like \"Russia,\" \"Ukraine\" and \"election,\" according to data compiled by the technology company Integral Ad Science.\"Impeachment\" is another no-no. In December 2018, few companies blocked that word. A year later, nearly 50 companies had done so.Some brand executives have told ad agencies that they are afraid of alienating customers or drawing the wrath of the presidential Twitter account.\"It's a divided world that we live in,\" said Raja Rajamannar, the chief marketing officer at Mastercard. \"Can you afford to exclude half of your audience?\"Other companies are avoiding politically engaged ads out of simple fatigue.\"Trump has been in America's 24-hour news cycle for the past four years: countless hours of 'Saturday Night Live' skits, tweets, memes, #resistance microsites, etc.,\" Zachary Roif, an associate creative director at the marketing agency R/GA, said in an email. \"People have simply had enough -- enough outrage, enough disdain, enough shock value to the point where making a statement feels a little tired.\"And then there is the risk of offending Mr. Trump and how that could affect business.\"This notion that you pick on a president and then he tweets about you and is mean to your company is a new thing,\" said Eamonn Store, the chief executive of the consulting firm FairShare and a former North American chief executive of Guardian News & Media. \"If you happen to be a large technology brand like Microsoft, and the government is your biggest client, then the last thing you need is to be in conflict with the White House.\"Many companies, Mr. Store added, believe Mr. Trump will win re-election. If that happens, he said, \"being the pro-impeachment enterprise is not going to be good for business.\"The president has railed against Amazon, Google and Harley-Davidson. When Nike announced in 2018 that it had entered into a new marketing deal with the former N.F.L. quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had angered the administration by kneeling during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism, Mr. Trump said on Twitter, \"Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts.\"Things are different on the other side of the Atlantic. Before the fractious general election in Britain last month, Burger King put up an ad on the sides of a double-decker bus featuring a photo of a burger and the tagline \"Another Whopper on the side of a bus. Must be an election.\" The British supermarket chain Tesco commented cheekily on the political discord with an advertisement showing bottles of liquor crowded around the words \"Time for a cabinet reshuffle.\"This is the kind of advertising -- politically engaged, cheerfully flippant -- that is not making the rounds in the United States.In recent years companies have been willing to associate themselves with broad messages on social issues, using ads to support female empowerment, the environment and other causes that do not raise many hackles. But the specifics of 2020 seem too hot to touch.\"It just feels wrong right now,\" Mr. Verdi said.PhotographPolitically themed ads were common in the last election cycle, as in a Chrysler commercial starring Martin Sheen, above center, and Bill Pullman, but the mood has changed since President Trump's election.

President Trump never uttered the word impeachment, but in a 78-minute speech to the nation that combined a celebration of the American economy, hard-edge policy pronouncements and reality show-style surprises for the audience, he made the case for his presidency as only he could.It was not a case that persuaded Democrats, who remained seated stonily during the applause lines, shaking their heads and rolling their eyes, but it was not meant to. Assured of acquittal in the Senate trial on Wednesday, Mr. Trump moved past preserving his first term and focused on securing a second with an argument aimed at both his political base and dubious suburban voters.It had a surreal quality, a president on trial for high crimes and misdemeanors addressing lawmakers in the same House chamber where he was impeached just seven weeks ago. While Mr. Trump resisted the impulse to show up at the Senate trial to reject the charges against him over the last couple of weeks, he used his State of the Union address to present a different sort of defense without the burden of cross-examination, in effect arguing that the \"great American comeback\" he claimed credit for outweighed the allegations against him.If Democrats were unmoved, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi ostentatiously ripped up her copy of his speech once it was done, making sure the cameras would catch the moment, Republicans embraced the president many of them once scorned. They welcomed him with hearty applause and even chanted, \"Four more years! Four more years!\" as if it were a campaign rally rather than an affair of state.On its surface, the speech presented an optimistic assessment of the country and its progress, perhaps reflecting his sense of his own. \"America's enemies are on the run, America's fortunes are on the rise, and America's future is blazing bright,\" Mr. Trump said.But he also laid out a darker view of an America still plagued by \"criminal aliens,\" terrorized by Islamic radicals and threatened by budding socialists eager to take over the health care system.Throughout his time in the chamber, the president seemed sullen, even gloomy, barely cracking a smile and making no attempts at humor. He refused to shake Ms. Pelosi's hand when he handed her his speech and she refused to say it was a \"distinct honor\" to present him when she announced him, both abandoning custom.All around Mr. Trump were reminders of his ordeal over the last several months. One of the members of the escort committee that brought him in, Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, is part of the team of House Democrats prosecuting him. The president encountered Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the Senate trial and seemed intent on maintaining a studious neutral expression during their brief exchange.While he made no mention of impeachment, Mr. Trump did single out Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader who has single-handedly ensured he would survive the trial without witnesses testifying against him. \"Thank you, Mitch,\" Mr. Trump said at one point, referring to the senator's help confirming judges, but it would not be surprising if he were grateful for other reasons.The president's grim mood belied what was otherwise a good day for him. Aside from his coming acquittal and the chance to address the largest television audience of the year uninterrupted, Mr. Trump earlier in the day reveled in the Democratic dysfunction in the Iowa caucus and avidly sought to exploit it to promote suspicion among his rivals.He and his sons and allies pumped out Twitter messages suggesting the botched Iowa count was an effort to rig the election for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and against Senator Bernie Sanders, the candidate the president would rather face in the fall.\"It's a fiasco that just plays right into us,\" the president told television network anchors during an off-the-record lunch earlier in the day, according to people in the room.\"What other people would look at as a moment of completely political meltdown for this president, it all appears to accrue to his benefit,\" said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. \"He actually looks like the adult in the room.\"Democrats acknowledged that the Iowa breakdown played to Mr. Trump's advantage, at least in the short term.\"A fractious, divisive, and chaotic process inevitably takes focus away from Trump's own failures, at least in the short term, and Trump obviously believes he has the opportunity to stir the pot against the Democrats in these circumstances,\" said Geoff Garin, a prominent Democratic pollster. \"All of this heightens the importance for Democrats to have a confident and united front as soon as possible.\"The Iowa debacle played out even as Gallup reported that Mr. Trump's approval rating had climbed to 49 percent, its highest in that survey since his presidency began. While not a strong number historically, it is higher than either Barack Obama or Bill Clinton had going into their State of the Union speeches in the years they ultimately won re-election, though not as high as George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan had in theirs.Not that he can necessarily count on any of this to last. The economy, while healthy, has slowed its growth and could take a hit from the China travel restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus outbreak. At some point, the Democrats will anoint a nominee who could unify the party against Mr. Trump. And John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, plans to publish a book next month that is expected to offer revelations about the president's use of his office to further his own political interests.Mr. Trump has shown a remarkable capacity for crossing lines and creating political problems for himself just when things appear to be better for him. Indeed, he placed the phone call to Ukraine's president that got him impeached the day after testimony by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III made clear that he was out of political jeopardy as a result of the Russia investigation.But for one night, at least, the president had the stage to himself and he made the most of it. With a mix of schmaltz and showmanship, he pulled one surprise after another on the audience.At one point, he introduced Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host who just announced that he has advanced lung cancer, and seemed to stun the broadcaster by announcing that he would bestow on him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Rather than wait, the president then had Melania Trump pull the medal out and drape it around Mr. Limbaugh's neck right there in the first lady's box, surely the first time that has happened at a State of the Union address.In another uplifting moment, he gave a scholarship to a fourth-grade girl also sitting in the box. At the same time, he introduced a variety of figures with tragic stories, the parents of a woman killed by the Islamic State, the widow and son of a soldier killed in Iraq, the brother of a man shot by an undocumented immigrant.But he saved the most tear-jerking moment for the end, when he thanked the wife of an Army soldier deployed to Afghanistan -- then announced that her husband in fact had returned to the country, as the soldier suddenly appeared in the box to her great surprise.The president's address took place just across the Capitol and hours after senators took to the floor to announce their vote in his trial -- Republicans steadfastly pledging to acquit, Democrats resolutely vowing to convict, the two-thirds required by the Constitution for removal clearly nowhere in sight.Chief Justice Roberts, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Jeffries and the rest will return to the Senate chamber at 4 p.m. on Wednesday to tally those votes, inevitable as they now seem, and to wrap up the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.Mr. Trump presumably will not show up in person. But he told the anchors in their lunch that he wanted to make a speech after the vote, another kind of speech, not so much a state of the union but a valedictory after months of battle -- in his view, a comeback of a different sort.Maggie Haberman and Annie Karni contributed reporting from Washington, and Michael M.

He wrote that he was \"certain\" that he would have won, but had instead decided to focus on ensuring that Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020.\"I am truly humbled by the outpouring of support I have received from people across New Hampshire and the country,\" he said, adding that he would endorse a Republican candidate \"in the near future.\"A bid by Mr. Lewandowski would have had support from key parts of Mr. Trump's political apparatus in a rare race where Republicans would have a chance to pick up a Senate seat in 2020. It would also have tested the appetite for Trumpism in a purple state with a Republican governor where Hillary Clinton very narrowly won in 2016 and Ms. Shaheen won her Senate race two years earlier by less than three percentage points.At least three Republicans are already in the contest: William O'Brien, a former speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives; Donald Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general; and Corky Messner, a businessman and veteran.In August, Mr. Trump all but endorsed Mr. Lewandowski in an interview with a New Hampshire radio host. \"I will say this -- if he ran, he would be a great senator. If he ran and won, he'd be a great senator,\" Mr. Trump said in the interview.Mr. Lewandowski helped Mr. Trump notch his first primary victory in New Hampshire in February 2016, which began Mr. Trump's march to the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Trump's children fired Mr. Lewandowski as the campaign manager less than five months later, but the president would retain a fondness for him and would speak with him often.If he had run in New Hampshire, Mr. Lewandowski's business activities would have been the subject of intense scrutiny. While Mr. Trump has been in office, Mr. Lewandowski has been an adviser to companies that have interests with the government.In May 2017, Mr. Lewandowski left the lobbying firm he helped start, Avenue Strategies, amid questions about whether he was lobbying without having registered. Since then, Mr. Lewandowski has had private clients and for many months gave paid speeches to various groups. Mr. Lewandowski has previously said that he was not a lobbyist, and that he had never called government officials on behalf of a client.Nonetheless, some Republicans, both in New Hampshire and in Washington, had expressed skepticism about whether Mr. Lewandowski would ultimately enter the Senate race, in part because doing so would have forced him to file financial disclosure forms that would have provided additional details about his work.Mr. Lewandowski has also faced allegations of assault: In 2016, during the campaign, he was accused of grabbing a reporter for Breitbart News who was trying to ask Mr. Trump questions. Mr. Lewandowski was charged with simple battery by the police in Jupiter, Fla.; the charges were later dropped. The following year, a pop singer accused Mr. Lewandowski of slapping her twice on the buttocks at a party in Washington.In a statement on Tuesday, a spokesman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party sought to tie Republicans to Mr. Lewandowski and Mr. Trump even without Mr. Lewandowski in the race.\"Every Republican running for Senate in New Hampshire has stood proudly with Corey Lewandowski and Donald Trump in their efforts to take away health care from tens of thousands of Granite Staters and reverse Roe v. Wade,\" said the spokesman, Josh Marcus-Blank. \"While Messner, Bolduc and O'Brien tear each other down in the contentious primary Lewandowski has left behind, Senator Shaheen will continue working across the aisle for New Hampshire, leading efforts to lower prescription drug costs and making sure veterans and their families get the benefits they deserve.\"Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.PhotographCorey Lewandowski was President Trump's first campaign manager in 2016.

Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, some of the loudest applause was heard from Pete Hegseth, a Fox News host and a decorated veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\"He's a terrorist who has killed Americans. We knew where he was and the president took a bold move to get rid of him, and people around the globe are thankful for that,\" Mr. Hegseth said on the set of \"Fox & Friends,\" a perch he often takes to validate -- and at times influence -- Mr. Trump's military policies.That was the same Mr. Hegseth who has defended the president's cozy interactions with Kim Jong-un, embraced Mr. Trump's \"America first\" agenda of withdrawing forces abroad -- and reversing interventionist policies he labeled irresolute and shameful -- and energetically taken up the cause of combat veterans accused of war crimes.But at no point during Mr. Trump's presidency has Mr. Hegseth loomed larger, with the United States on a war footing and the next step unknown. Among the president's unofficial policy advisers and those who add to the echo chamber on Fox News talk shows, no one else channels Mr. Trump's mix of avowed isolationism, impulsive interventionism and unexpected resort to force.\"If I was part of shaping the narrative\" concerning the strike on General Suleimani, Mr. Hegseth said in a telephone interview on Monday, \"well, that's a wonderful part of my day job.\"Mr. Hegseth's views, which have greatly evolved since his time in the Army and his tenure leading two conservative veterans organizations, are emblematic of the seismic shift among many Republicans under Mr. Trump on long-held foreign policy positions. They also reflect a slow but significant souring among veterans on the post-9/11 conflicts that many believe have cost the nation too much in lives and money.\"I think a lot of us who were very hawkish and believe in American military might and strength were very resistant to how candidate Trump characterized the wars,\" Mr. Hegseth said in another recent telephone interview. \"But if we are honest with ourselves, there is no doubt that we need to radically reorient how we do it. How much money have we invested, how many lives have we invested and has it actually made us safer? Is it still worth it?\"Mr. Hegseth's influence was most pronounced late last year when he lobbied heavily on behalf of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a member of the Navy SEALs who was acquitted of serious war crimes. Mr. Trump reversed a demotion ordered as punishment, and then fired the secretary of the Navy, whom Mr. Hegseth had aggressively criticized.Mr. Hegseth took to Fox News in November to defend Chief Gallagher. \"From the beginning, this was overzealous prosecutors who were not giving the benefit of the doubt to the trigger pullers,\" he said.He spoke to Mr. Trump several times about the case. Mr. Trump subsequently tagged Mr. Hegseth in tweets on the issue, a public confirmation of his interactions with the president.Having been successful in the Gallagher case, Mr. Hegseth has now taken up the cause of winning pardons for the Blackwater security contractors who were found guilty in the 2007 shooting of dozens of unarmed Iraqis in Baghdad.Mr. Hegseth's shift has alienated some longtime allies.\"I respect his service,\" said William Kristol, a conservative analyst and former mentor to Mr. Hegseth. \"I knew him 10 years ago and hoped he would be one of many leaders of that generation for strong American policy. But he has now apologized for war crimes and is a demagogue for Trump.\"Mr. Hegseth's rallying around Mr. Trump's order to attack General Suleimani has turned off some opponents of the \"forever wars\" who see opportunism. Voices like Tucker Carlson, another Fox host who has become strongly antiwar, and Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative group that Mr. Hegseth once led, have remained true to their war fatigue. Not Mr. Hegseth.\"I have been debating Pete Hegseth for 12 years, and I can't tell you what he stands for other than himself and his own ambition,\" said Jon Soltz, who served as an Army officer in the Iraq war and is a founder of VoteVets, a liberal group that advocates for veterans.In 2009, Mr. Hegseth defended the surge in Afghanistan in repeated debates with Mr. Soltz, who was a critic of President Barack Obama and warned at the time that Iran was becoming empowered in Iraq.\"I don't share the concern that President Trump is dragging us into endless war here,\" Mr. Hegseth said. \"In fact, I hate the term 'endless war' as it pertains to Iran.\"The transformation of Mr. Hegseth -- an Ivy League-educated, decorated Army platoon leader and former ally of Senator John McCain -- from fierce advocate of militarism abroad to passionate Trumpist trumpet is a symbol of the Republican Party in the Trump era.Scores of buttoned-up, Russia-deploring free traders with a deep reserve of tolerance for military involvements abroad have cast aside core beliefs to embrace Mr. Trump, their new personas validated and amplified by the heavily groomed, assembled supporters on the Fox set, where Mr. Hegseth now sits.He has scored the rare dual posts of cable star and unofficial Trump adviser; Mr. Trump considered him for the jobs of White House press secretary and secretary of veterans affairs.Mr. Hegseth, a Minnesota native, graduated from Princeton University, where he was the publisher of The Princeton Tory, a conservative magazine for which he wrote about seeing the statue of Saddam Hussein toppled in Baghdad. \"Conservative ideas have worked, do work and will continue to work,\" he concluded. \"The list is long: A strong military is absolutely essential to bringing long-term peace and stability to the world.\"After earning his Army commission via Princeton's Reserve Officers Training Corps, he served with a National Guard unit guarding detainees at Guantánamo Bay in 2004 and 2005.\"He was a highly disciplined, highly focused, very intelligent officer and soldier who was really committed to serving his country,\" said Ziad Shehady, who served with Mr. Hegseth.In 2005, Mr. Hegseth volunteered to deploy to Iraq and was assigned to the Third Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division. There, Mr. Hegseth served under Col. Michael D. Steele, a hard-charging Army Ranger officer who was part of the Black Hawk Down episode in Somalia, a leader devoted to aggressive tactics to ferret out and kill suspected terrorist operatives, recorded on \"kill boards\" on base.After Mr. Hegseth left, Colonel Steele oversaw Operation Iron Triangle, after which three American soldiers were convicted of murder for killing Iraqi prisoners. Colonel Steele was formally reprimanded but did not face charges.\"On that tour my eyes were open,\" Mr. Hegseth said. \"I was exposed to the reality of human nature, a vicious enemy, and I was forged and taught by these incredible patriots and warriors.\"Colonel Steele \"understood the warrior ethos was very real,\" Mr. Hegseth said, and under his command, he learned that \"you subdue violence with violence.\"The experience helped shape his views of men accused of war crimes, said Mr. Hegseth, who has advised that \"guys who make tough choices on the battlefield be given the benefit of the doubt.\"Pentagon and military leaders have said that Mr. Trump's decisions could greatly reduce their ability to enforce discipline and could weaken the chain of command among the 1.3 million Americans on active duty.Mr. Hegseth vehemently disagreed with that view, his single flash of anger during a lengthy interview. \"You can maintain good order and discipline without throwing warriors under the bus,\" he said, adding, \"I think most of these characterizations are made by people who have never been in the type of situation that Gallagher has been in.\"If endorsing strong-arm tactics while opposing a conservative military strategy seems complicated, that is the new normal under Mr. Trump.\"When you get caught up in a movement, sometimes you promote things that make emotional sense at the moment but don't really make any sense overall,\" said Wade Zirkle, a Denver businessman and veteran who founded the pro-interventionist Vets for Freedom, then recruited Mr. Hegseth to take over.Mr. Zirkle credits Mr. Hegseth with raising money and the organization's profile but was surprised by his populist turn. \"He is enabling the president who has no respect for the military or respect for U.S. alliances abroad,\" Mr. Zirkle said.After Mr. Obama announced the Afghanistan troop increase, Mr. Hegseth volunteered to deploy to Kabul in 2011 and 2012. As a senior counterinsurgency instructor, \"I saw the clear disconnect between our strategy and reality,\" he said. \"We were selling a connect-with-the-locals message even though we knew that was not working.\"Mr. Hegseth left the military early to run for the Senate in Minnesota but withdrew when he lost ground to a Tea Party candidate who then lost the general election. He earned a master's degree in public policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, then became the leader of Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group with ties to Charles Koch that has also been influential on Mr. Trump's views of veterans health care.Mr. Hegseth found the president's ear and more attention from Fox News bookers. \"It was never my intention to forge a relationship\" with the president, he said. \"I know that I have learned a great deal from the truths he has told, his courage on these issues to speak plainly and truly about topics that are usually spoken about in code.\"Over the last year, Mr. Hegseth has seemed to move further and further from the bookish veteran of his initial television appearances. He was recently banned from Twitter -- where he has expressed support for the conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer's congressional campaign and retweeted the cartoonist Ben Garrison, who has been called anti-Semitic -- for posting part of a manifesto written by a Saudi aviation student who killed three people at Naval Air Station Pensacola.Mr. Hegseth has also earned criticism with some of his Fox commentary supporting Mr. Trump's more incendiary moments. He defended the president's comments after the 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Va., during which a white nationalist killed a protester by crashing his car into the crowd.\"There's a reason those people were out there,\" he said. \"Some of it is outright racism and needs to be condemned. A lot of it, though, is I feel like my country is slipping away and just because I talk about nationalism, not white nationalism, doesn't mean I'm talking in code, that I'm a racist.\"Despite his criticism of many conflicts overseas, Mr. Hegseth recently rejoined the Army as a commissioned major in the National Guard in Washington. From there, he could face deployment to a conflict with Iran.\"We are in a generational struggle against radical Islam,\" he said.\"I wouldn't put my views in a libertarian box or neocon box,\" he concluded. \"I believe in putting America first.\"PhotographPresident Trump with the \"Fox & Friends\" host Pete Hegseth at a Make America Great Again rally in Billings, Mont., in September.

In pressing inexorably toward their preordained vote of acquittal, Senate Republicans made it clear they see their fortunes and futures intertwined with the president's, and are not willing to rock the 2020 boat.\"Their party is a cult of personality at this point,\" said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut.Senators who normally are jealous guardians of their power over federal spending seemed to brush aside Mr. Trump's attempt to hold up military aid that Congress had allocated to Ukraine, an ally fighting Russian aggression on its eastern border. Mr. Trump's pressure campaign to leverage that aid in return for investigations of his political rivals is at the heart of the impeachment trial.The transformation of the Senate can be seen in the way Trump-like tactics have seeped in over recent days. Senator Martha McSally, the Arizona Republican appointed to replace John McCain, called a CNN reporter a \"liberal hack\" after he posed a routine question -- a break with civil press relations of the past. She then immediately started raising campaign money off it.Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, the newest member of the Senate through her recent appointment, attacked Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, her fellow Republican, on Twitter for trying to \"appease the left\" by backing the idea of witnesses.Her clear aim was to curry favor with Mr. Trump and she may well have scored a success. But it was hard to imagine a freshly minted senator of the past arriving in Washington and almost immediately questioning the motives and views of a more senior senator who was also the former presidential nominee of her own party -- after making significant campaign contributions to him in the past.It is worth noting that Ms. Loeffler was appointed to fill the seat of the ailing Johnny Isakson, a Republican known for his bipartisan approach in the Senate and his love and respect for the institution. And Ms. McSally represents a distinct contrast with Mr. McCain, a frequent subject of criticism from the president and a man who closed out his career by depriving Mr. Trump of his campaign promise to repeal the Obama administration's new health care law.The departures of Mr. McCain and Mr. Isakson are just part of the steady loss of members willing to go their own way when it comes to the president. Outgoing senators are often replaced by much more conservative successors who have attached themselves to the president. It was lost on no member of the Senate that Jeff Flake of Arizona was essentially driven out for his willingness to find public fault with the president.Bob Corker of Tennessee, the former Republican senator who spoke up against Mr. Trump on occasion and drew the president's ire, decided not to seek another term in 2018 and has been replaced by Senator Marsha Blackburn, a conservative former House member who has been biting in her criticism of the impeachment trial and the presentation by House Democrats.\"It's time to end this impeachment farce and get back to work for the American people,\" Ms. Blackburn said this week on Twitter.The shift has not been lost on former senators of both parties who are watching with dismay as the impeachment trial unfolds with a marked partisanship at odds from the trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, when lawmakers found a way to work out their disagreements over the shape of the trial.\"Not long ago, senators of both major parties always worked to accommodate fellow colleagues with different points of view to arrive at outcomes that would best serve the nation's interests,\" John Warner, a former senator from Virginia, said in a statement. Mr. Warner, who saw himself as a protector of the institution, said he worried that a trial without witnesses would do \"lasting damage to the Senate, and to our fragile national consensus.\"Over the years, senators saw themselves as power centers of their own, rising above the House and able to show more independence because of their six-year terms and wider statewide representation. Early on, that sensibility was reflected in their arms-length approach to Mr. Trump when he was still a candidate. Many senators had little to no previous relationship with him.During the primary campaign, two prominent Republican senators challenging him -- Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas -- frequently raised alarm over the prospect of Mr. Trump in the White House. Mr. Cruz even shied away from endorsing him at the party's nominating convention. Both paid a price in Twitter abuse from the president, and both are now among his most ardent defenders.After Mr. Trump's election, other senators -- in private and public settings -- said they were concerned about the president's fitness for office and his Twitter rants against his critics and rivals. Senators split on a few issues and did not show the same fierce loyalty of Republican House members.Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, who has exhibited an independent streak, confronted the president in the White House in 2017 over his attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, saying she was sent to Washington to represent her constituents and not toe the party line. She followed that up with a vote against Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, Mr. Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court.But on Friday, as Ms. Murkowski cast an important vote against calling witnesses, she sounded a few Trumpian notes in lashing into Democrats for what she saw as a partisan show.\"It has also become clear some of my colleagues intend to further politicize this process, and drag the Supreme Court into the fray, while attacking the chief justice,\" she said, referring to repeated efforts by Democrats to have Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., rule in favor of witnesses and to a question from Senator Elizabeth Warren that was critical of the chief justice. \"I will not stand for nor support that effort. We have already degraded this institution for partisan political benefit, and I will not enable those who wish to pull down another.\"Republicans in tough re-election fights -- Ms. McSally, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado and Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, among others -- are of the view that they need Mr. Trump, and his supporters in their states, to win.Democrats say they now fear that Mr. Trump, emboldened by his expected Senate acquittal, will be even less restrained exerting his authority. They aren't counting on Senate Republicans to do much about it.Trump on Trial is a continuing series of articles offering reporting, analysis and impressions of the Senate impeachment proceedings.Trump on Trial is a continuing series of articles offering reporting, analysis and impressions of the Senate impeachment proceedings.PhotographPresident Trump at the White House on Friday.
